ESCAPE FROM EARTH
Christina Capra
FADE IN:
MONTAGE – 2273 CE
—   EARTH seen from orbit—an almost cloudless atmosphere—with no icecaps—continental shapes unrecognizable.
MEC (VO)
Most of earth is covered by desert or ocean, with a narrow band of scrub forests around the equator, and patchy scrub in the far northern and far southern climes.
—   Watched by big-bellied, club-wielding, goggle-wearing GUARDS dressed in dirty black and white uniforms, emaciated PRISONERS haul empty nets aboard a long, muscle-powered boat.
MEC (VO)
The oceans are near death. Down from 25 percent in 1958, atmospheric oxygen levels are at
—   Skeletal REMAINS of a city and hulks of bridge pillars protrude through drifting sands. Decayed BRIDGES span bone- dry riverbeds.
MEC (VO)
Hordes of rulebreakers live and breed below ground in abandoned mines or in subway and maintenance tunnels—slave labor for strip mines, extraction of protein from oceans, and for the salvage of refined metals for orbital habitat construction. Farming is dead ... possible solely on tiny plots in former Siberian and Canadian lands.
—   Bare FEET lope through sand and around sage: hairy human feet ... yet with inch-long CLAWS that curl from toenail beds.
MEC (VO)
Life expectancy is 37 years. Escape impossible: For humans who try, a short life becomes breath-takingly shorter. Rulebreaker and clone hunts are broadcast live, though surface winds often render flight risky for airborne nanocameras.
—   Massive orbhabs circle the earth.
MEC (VO)
TO BLACK & FADE ...
APPLAUSE mixed with cacophonic background CHATTER.
ANNOUNCER (VO)
At Orbital Broadcasting Services our watchwords are: fair, just and objective.
MEC (VO)
Unlike most humans, I read rather than scan, and history fascinates me; so I understand that three centuries of passive entertainment has shortened attention spans and destroyed desire to learn.
Applause and chatter fizzles into the CHIRPS of crickets and CROAKS of frogs.
IN:
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT – 2021 CE
Breathing hard, CLOSE (30s), BLAKE, and CURRY pause for a rest. They wear jailhouse-orange coveralls.
CLOSE
To hell with this shit. I’m gonna disarm one of those creeps an’ fight my way out.
BLAKE
You know I can’t let you do that. Damnit, you’ll get us killed!
Close delivers a well-placed fist to Blake’s soft belly. Older, Blake chokes and gags.
CLOSE
Your money let you run a crew of thunks and thuds in prison. Out here, you’re lost. So zip it.
Curry pulls a shank to defend his boss and steps forward.
Close grasps the back of Curry’s hand and forearm, jerks down while he drives a knee upward into the wrist. Bone SNAPS. Curry screams.
CLOSE
(to Curry)
If you try, Curry, you an’ Blake can turn yourselves in an’ get some medical attention.
TO BLACK & FADE ...
The sounds of crickets, frogs, gagging, and choking diminish, then fade out; APPLAUSE and CHATTER return, almost drown out the Announcer’s words.
ANNOUNCER (VO)
With our watchwords in mind, we now proudly bring you ...
Applause abruptly halts. Chatter dies more slowly. Silence.
LOUDER FEMALE VOICE (VO)
Did he say Justice For All is coming on live? I heard they’re executing a killer clone!
... IN
INT. ORBHAB CABIN - DAY - 2273 CE
Com-helmeted and vid-visored, a MAN and WOMAN burst through the
entry hatch, into a small, yet plushly furnished cabin. They stop before a huge, bulkhead vid screen. The woman gobbles and handful of capsules.
ANNOUNCER (VO)
You heard me correctly; we are broadcasting live!
At the outside edges, the helmet VISORS have small screens which throw flashing lights onto gaudily made-up FACES.
The woman taps keyboards on the sides of her helmet while the man punches buttons on a wrist device. The woman also monitors her visor screens and listens to Jerica’s voice. All three chatter non-stop:
WOMAN              MAN
I know what I heard! Not      One minute, Randy. You’re you, Marchelle! Jerica       always hearing stuff nobody
heard it, too!          else hears.
JERICA (VO)
Heard what? I didn’t hear anything. Did Marchelle say she heard it, too?
Genetically enhanced muscles bulging, earrings hanging from lobes to collarbone, the man sports eye make-up, lip paint, and an electric green suit. Matching green hair sprouts from his helmet.
WOMAN              MAN
Hear what? Marchelle is      I know I’m talking to you! always on OBS. You aren’t     I’m trying to get OBS talking to her! I am!       because a chase is coming on!
JERICA (VO)
I know I’m not talking to Marchelle. David, get out of your your clothes! We are not finished. You’re not going out till you get me off!
The slim woman wears a suit the same color as the man’s, but she has bright yellow hair, plus genetically enlarged, grossly overdone breasts and buttocks.
ON THE BULKHEAD SCREEN:
A SHADOW looms over desert sand. A light-skinned, elephant-like trunk sniffs the sand.
The SCREEN goes dark. BACK TO SCENE
WOMAN              MAN
... Gorgeous shade of       I would love watching a MEC-
green with beige high-      Class female get eaten alive
lights and this dress       by a spoor stalker ... after is positively slinky ...      I had sex with the clone.
JERICA (VO)
If you think you’ll pop off then leave without doing me ...
The man frantically punches buttons on his wrist device, then speaks into its mike.
MAN
Hambly? Are the odds 50 to 1? ... Good. I want four credits on the MEC ... to survive four days. If the over/under is eleven and a half, gimme three credits on the over for the body count.
The woman slaps at his face, but cuts her ... HAND
... On the bottom edge of his visor.
ANNOUNCER (VO)
... Apologize for technical difficulties. The Vacu-Grav cameras covering the search for this fugitive, a MEC-Class clone ... yes, you heard me correctly ... are currently out of service.
When BLOOD wells, the man takes one look and faints.
EXT. FOREST - DAY - 2021 CE
Amidst the sounds of distant GUNFIRE and the WHINE of passing bullets, running four FEET kick up dead leaves, feet covered with cheap, slip-on deck shoes and attached to legs draped in jailhouse orange. Then they stop.
BLAKE (OS)
Don’t shoot! We surrender!
On full-auto, several M-16s CHATTER.
INT. ORBITAL SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY - 2273 CE
Stacked panopticon screens circle the rotunda. INSERT - PANOPTICON SCREENS
The upper screen covers desert terrain where lower four screens
display various orbital habitat scenes—PEOPLE out shopping or in their PRIVATE quarters.
BACK TO SCENE
ANNOUNCER (VO)
Until we re-establish service, we shall bring you live coverage of the actual hunt and executions from spoor stalker cameras.
More women than men. Flashy clothing. More overdone breasts, butts, and muscles. Facial jewelry on all.
AUDIENCE (VO)
(a chorus of boos)
GLEEBOK stands in the pod’s center. He studies the circling desert scenes.
GLEEBOK
On your toes, people. We know this MEC-Class clone has many talents, but it cannot simply disappear.
Find the damned thing!
Most of the many TECHNICIANS also study the desert image flow.
At one station, SEPH isolates a few feet of imagery, spins her chair to make an across-the-pod comparison.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Small running FEET churn sand—feet encased in tan colored cloth. Human feet.
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY – 2021 CE
PILOT (Comlink) You got something?
A Thermal-Imaging TECH studies a bright DOT on her monitor’s green field.
TECH (Comlink)
No. It’s gotta be a U.S. Marshal
... one of the recon guys.
PILOT (Comlink) I better check.
TECH (Comlink)
No need. He’s walking toward the Mobile Base Post ... not running away from it.
EXT. DESERT - DAY - 2273 CE
ANNOUNCER (VO)
Speed-enhanced, this clone has reflexes as fast, or faster than the newer model spoor stalkers. And should it somehow defeat those, it has been pledged to the Planetary Guard Cadre ... if the exiles can capture it ...
Wearing a brown body suit, a small young woman (MEC) runs over barren ground. She carries a fist-sized stone in each hand, and though her goggled eyes scan the terrain ahead, every few strides she checks her backtrail.
ANNOUNCER (VO)
... Which should provide some rather sexy viewing.
EXT. FOREST - DAY - 2021 CE
Many running FEET wearing combat boots. Rifle FIRE. Brass cartridge CASES clink against each other as they hit the ground.
Running FEET. A pair of BOOTS.
FBI AGENT (OS)
Roble Close! Halt! This is the FBI!
Close runs for his life. He now wears cammies, Nike sunglasses, and totes a Bureau of Prisons backpack. He carries an M-16 in his hands and has a pistol strapped to his waist.
ANNOUNCER (VO)
In addition, no fewer than seven dangerous Death Watch rulebreakers will have their punishments meted out today.
Slugs knock BARK from trees, kick up dust GEYSERS.
Close ducks behind an oak tree, steps out and fires one round.
Four PURSUERS dive for cover while the FBI Agent drops in his tracks. He screams, presses both hands to a bloody hip.
FBI AGENT
Help me! I’m hit!
Far down the path, other MANHUNTERS return fire.
EXT. DESERT - DAY - 2273 CE
From high ground, Mec spots a loping figure, indistinct in the distance: a SPOOR STALKER.
She ups her speed a notch.
EXT. FOREST - DAY - 2021 CE
Close stands on a bluff fifteen feet above the river. When he empties the M-16 at a hovering HELICOPTER, the machine veers away.
He reloads while all around him, bullets churn DIRT and chew BRUSH.
Close jumps for the water.
EXT. DESERT - DAY - 2273 CE
Mec sprints down a dry river bed, toward a patch of exposed stones. Almost there ...
ROBLE CLOSE
... Drops into deep sand ... in her path.
Without slowing, Mec leaps over him. She stops, quickly scans the spread of rocks.
Disoriented, Close blinks, rises and looks around before his attention settles on Mec.
Lie down!
MEC
INT. ORBITAL SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
While Gleebok scowls at the screen, Seph frantically taps keys on her spherical boards.
GLEEBOK
What is it, Seph?
SEPH
A Subatomic Frequency Signature, just a flash, but sufficient.
Thermal Signature, too. (turns to Gleebok)
Neither is in our data banks.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Mec’s gaze, just for an instant, notes the KNIFE hung upside down on Close’s backpack shoulder strap. Then, right-handed, she hurls a ...
STONE
... Which sails over Close.
GLEEBOK (VO)
That’s apt to be rulebreaker- offspring, some lowlife born underground.
Too quickly, she throws a second with her left hand before snatching more rocks from the sand.
Behind Close, the ... SPOOR STALKER
... Bellows.
SEPH (VO)
I understand that, Gleebok, but how did it vanish?
Close springs to his feet.
CLOSE
What the hell!
Two more rocks WHIZZ past his head, slap into the pelt of blond hair below the stalker’s neck.
Close gawps:
The monster bellows again, brushes at his chest with clawed, but clearly human HANDS.
Human eyes set in a big skull. A foot-long, writhing, elephant trunk-like nose extends beyond a baboon-like snout. Long FANGS. Muscles to make Mr. Universe look downright girlish.
In a flash, Mec flits by Close, snatches his knife in passing. The stalker swipes at her, nicks her ear. The knife BLADE arcs upward, slices an artery under its arm. Mec cat foots away.
Close shuts his opened mouth.
CLOSE
What the hell am I waitin’ for?
He fires the M-16. BONE and GORE erupt from the huge skull. An EYE pops from a socket, lands at Mec’s feet.
MEC
Gunpowder weapon! Are you insane?
INT. ORBITAL SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY INSERT - PANOPTICON SCREEN
A desert scene jerks and jigs. Then freezes with blood DROPLETS clearly visible and identifiable. A few feet along the stream and still in motion, similar imagery turns topsy-turvy.
BACK TO SCENE
MALE TECH (OS)
Stalker down! We’ve lost vital signs!
Gleebok steps closer to examine the frozen imagery.
SEPH
No clone has ever killed a spoor stalker.
MALE TECH (OS)
God! What if that thing gets away?
Chatter cranks to a high volume among the techs, until a ... DOOR
... Slides open in a wall.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
When Mec turns to a wide-eyed Close, he levels the 16 at her.
CLOSE
Nobody moves that fast. So you stay the hell back.
MEC
Habitat fugitive?
She studies him, obviously puzzled. Then, she motions him to follow her, and ...
Gets an emphatic headshake for an answer.
When Mec drops the knife, Close glances down, and small ... FEET
... Dance forward and ... HANDS
... Dart ... snatch his rifle. The knife sticks in the sand. Close draws his pistol, but ...
No threatening gesture from the woman. She simply examines the weapon, then ... hands it back. She retrieves the knife, cleans the blade in sand, then offers it haft first. She again motions him to follow.
CLOSE
Jesus-freakin’-Christ!
MEC
If you wish to live, you must follow me. Remain near me, within ten feet. No time for talk.
CLOSE
What the hell is that thing?
MEC
You actually do not know? Must follow me. Not follow, you will be eaten.
She stops, curiously eyes him.
CLOSE
Back. Stay the hell back! What kind of accent is that?
MEC
I apologize. I speak old American English, but among other ... engineers ... I use an abbreviated patois. Please forgive me if I lapse.
CLOSE
Where the hell am I? An’ who the hell are you?
Mec points to the dirt at his feet.
MEC
Come closer, please. You are in the Tennessee River Basin. I cannot permit your death. Follow me ... please.
CLOSE
Bullshit! I jumped into water!
She urges him forward.
MEC
Then why are you not wet?
Close stops three feet away, checks his shirt and pats his dry trousers.
MEC
Water has not flowed here for one hundred fifty years.
(points to her own chest) Am called Mec.
She pronounces the name with a short e.
CLOSE
I’m Close, an’ despite your cool name, you’re fulla shit. This river was fulla water five minutes ago.
Mec’s brow knits. She cocks her head to one side, stares at Close while she processes the information.
MEC
Another stalker will come soon. They are released at ten-minute intervals. Please stay near me.
Then, she motions him to follow and breaks into a jog.
CLOSE
A hundred fifty years, huh? What freakin’ year is this?
MEC
Is 2273. You must not delay. Under orbital surveillance.
She points skyward.
CLOSE
Bull-squirtin’-shit! It’s 2021, an’ everybody knows about the surveillance. NSA, CIA, the damned Defense Department, you name it, we have it watchin’ our assess.
INT. ORBITAL SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
PA SYSTEM
Supervisor Thelma Rigby!
Through the door and the streaming imagery steps THELMA RIGBY, a trim woman of indeterminate age and ethnicity. Gold peace symbols decorate the sleeves of her otherwise unadorned cobalt blue uniform.
Tech CHATTER instantly ceases. Fear returns tech attention to the image flow.
GLEEBOK
Rigby. Welcome. We are making—
RIGBY
I want results ... today.
Rigby casually about-faces. The image stream through which she exits shows the man and woman in green, chattering into microphones while they masturbate each other.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Close gasps where Mec seems to be out for a stroll.
CLOSE
Gotta ... s-stop. Too hot t-to breathe.
MEC
Rest. Five minutes. Then we must move.
Close drops the backpack, then drops to his butt beside it. He digs around inside, comes out with two cans and two beefsticks.
He hands the can and a piece of jerky to Mec. She hesitates, on point to see what he does.
When Close pops his TAB, she pops hers. He drinks; she drinks.
MEC
Is tasty!
She examines the aluminum can and watches Close open the package and gnaw the beefstick.
CLOSE
You don’t have cola here?
Mec bites into the beefstick. Makes a face that morphs into a radiant, child-like smile.
MEC
(headshake)
No cola but have seen vids. (waves the jerky)
Is what?
Beef.
CLOSE
MEC
Extinct. Never tasted meat. Humans have none. Use chemical substitutes to placate instincts.
CLOSE
Look, Mec, I don’t—
MEC
You have seen me run. You have seen and killed one spoor stalker. After I took your weapon, you trusted me sufficiently to follow my direction. Why would you not assume, for now, that I know this environment?
He shuts his eyes for a moment, then nods.
CLOSE
I’ve been chased by K-9 cops, some with bloodhounds. That thing’s olfactory membranes have to work the same way. It follows the dead skin cells we shed, an’ if we ...
He lets his words trail off as Mec shakes her head.
MEC
If 2021, then faulty 2021 evidence applied to 2273 is lethal. ...
Stalkers possess more intelligence than extinct chimpanzee. A stalker can follow a trail of only fifty molecules per mile. Too, your skin cells are linked with mine.
She squints down their backtrail.
MEC
How proficient are you with that gunpowder weapon?
CLOSE
Average. The rifle was designed to turn thunks and thuds into drive-by killers.
MEC
Drive-by? Thunks and thuds?
CLOSE
It’s not important ... unless you live in Chicago.
MEC
(nods)
Follow me, please. Shall walk, not run.
No sooner does Close turn, he spots two FIGURES in the distance.
CLOSE
Who the hell is—
MEC
Nearest is rulebreaker. Farthest is very fast spoor stalker.
Close unslings the rifle.
CLOSE
Come, on, we—
MEC
Are too late to help human. Stalkers eat meat, voraciously, fugitives or each other. They can eat themselves to death.
CLOSE
So if we kill this one, the next will eat until he’s sick.
MEC
Or slowed. Stalkers rip arteries, then sit—contentedly—and lick until the victim is drained. Is cola to stalkers.
CLOSE
Come on.
Far away, the figures come together, and Close hears the faint SCREAMS of the prisoner. He drops the pack, breaks into a run.
Mec catches him almost instantly, points to his chest.
MEC
YOU must remain next to me! Or die!
MEC
That poor slob—
Mec forces him to stop, holds out a hand.
MEC
Is dead. Give me one projectile.
Close detaches the magazine, thumbs out a round and passes it to her.
Mec throws it into the sands.
CLOSE
Shit! You could play center field for any pro—
MEC
Wait!
A thin trail of light streaks through the sky, right to the cartridge. A grenade-sized explosion blows sand high into the air.
CLOSE
Holy shit!
MEC
Gunpowder/brass detector. Electro- magnetic launchers fling ceramic missiles from orbit. Stay next to me.
CLOSE
Gotcha! I may crawl into that suit with you.
MEC
Sex later. Dangerous now.
His mouth drops open, but Mec’s attention is on the PRISONER and SPOOR STALKER. The screams have faded away.
Mec breaks into a slow jog.
A hundred yards from the feeding stalker, Close grabs her arm.
CLOSE
Good enough.
He lies prone, aligns his sights.
The bloody stalker rises, clearly more interested in protecting his kill than in gathering more meat.
Close fires, hits the stalker in the sternum. The animal wilts, collapses like a rag.
MEC
No one must discover how stalkers die. Your weapons are life ... perhaps freedom.
Close rises.
Follow me.
CLOSE
Close drops to a knee between the stalker and an emaciated old WOMAN with her guts ripped out.
CLOSE
That’s some kind of mutant. Built in a lab. Right? It can’t be natural. What’s this?
He points to a projection on the stalker’s head.
CLOSE
Shit! That’s a camera lens.
He places a thumb over the lens.
CLOSE
Who the fuck is watching us?
INT. ORBITAL SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
A span of desert IMAGERY that includes the old woman’s body goes BLACK.
MEC (VO)
The stalkers hunt me. My execution is being televised ... entertainment for all citizens.
Gleebok moves closer to have a look.
CLOSE (VO)
Ain’t happenin’. Not while you’re with me. So, you’re a criminal?
GLEEBOK
Explanations?
SEPH
I haven’t seen anything like this.
GLEEBOK
Think, goddamnit! We have millions of viewers on hold who want to watch and to hear the resolution of this case. Fix it! Or would you rather explain your ineptitude to Thelma Rigby?
EXT. DESERT - EVENING
Close is beginning to stagger ... but the sight of water energizes him. A small lake. He takes off.
Even though Mec carries the pack, rifle and pistol, she easily runs beside him.
MEC
Stop! Observe. Is desert, yet plants should grow near the shore.
The entire shoreline is barren.
MEC
Lakes common. Spring fed. Is good water far below ground. Is toxic on surface.
CLOSE
Thanks.
MEC
Night winds lift surface soil, which contains deadly chemicals. Winds die at dawn. Toxins fall into water. Must also protect your eyes in wind. Chemicals burn. Sometimes damage sight beyond repair.
CLOSE
So, how do we drink?
MEC
Tomorrow, we shall find PGC guards and steal their water. Now we must find shelter for the night.
CLOSE
Why is their water okay? What’s a PGC guard?
MEC
Comes from springs deep underground. No pollution. Planetary Guard Cadre is comprised of prisoners who now guard other prisoners.
LATER:
CLOSE
Kapos ... again.
Mec stops on a low hill, and Close stumbles into her. She points.
A box car a quarter mile away: The tracks are covered with drifted sand and the car’s wheels are buried.
MEC
Shelter.
Close perks up ... a little. He trudges forward.
INT. RAILCAR - LAST LIGHT
Three feet of fine sand covers the floor.
MEC
Dig ... here. Make a hole so you can lie lengthwise. Halfway through the sand.
Close stands mesmerized by the walls. Each holds eighteen-inch wide plank BUNKS—all the way to the ceiling—and each is equipped with HANDCUFFS and SHACKLES.
CLOSE
(snarls) Slave cars.
Mec studies Close for a beat, then drops to her knees. She puts the pack and weapons aside.
MEC
Close? You must dig. Now. We have less than one hour ... then ...
LATER:
Outside wind howls: Close lies on his back in the bottom of the hole. He shivers and every exhalation freezes.
Mec eases facedown on top of him.
MEC
My suit will warm you ... soon. Place your hands between our bodies. I shall cover our heads with your pack. Breath inside will save our faces, but we must move often to prevent frostbite in your feet.
Close tucks hands under her belly.
CLOSE
G-God, that’s w-warm. T-tell m-me about the s-suit.
She pulls the empty backpack over their heads.
MEC
My suit cools during in the daytime and generates heat for the night.
Neither cameras nor detectors can read signatures because my program disrupts subatomic frequencies at a ten-to-twenty-foot radius.
CLOSE
So, you’re a computer programmer?
MEC
A maintenance engineer. Another ... a friend programmed. Warm now?
CLOSE
Damned near cozy ... except for my feet.
MEC
Feel your erection. Your body wants sex but the brain knows the cold will kill us.
CLOSE
I apologize, but in self defense, I hafta say that you are the most
eye-pleasing woman I’ve ever seen.
MEC
Sleep. Shall wake you in thirty minutes to warm your feet.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Close halts at the railcar’s corner, bends to read an aluminum ID tag on the frame: U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY - HOMELAND SECURITY 2041.
CLOSE
Goddamned slavers!
MEC (OS)
Am slave. MEC-86-512. MEC means Maintenance Engineer slash Courtesan.
Close wheels. He gazes the length of the car at her ... then shakes his head.
MEC
Eighty-six is my model number, and I am the 512ᵗʰ manufactured. Brain imprinted for mechanical and electronic engineering.
CLOSE
Not any-goddamned-more, you aren’t. I don’t do slavery.
MEC
Am MEC-Class clone. My primary duty is ore-ship maintenance. My secondary function is sexual pleasure for the pilot, owner, or their designees.
Close gawps, obviously thinking she’s a nutcase.
CLOSE
Neither do I do forced sex.
LATER:
Close lugs the backpack and weapons, follows Mec at a leisurely pace.
CLOSE
Why aren’t we hurrying?
MEC
Winds killed the stalkers outside and scattered our molecules.
Mec makes a sweeping gesture with her arm.
MEC
Many eyes out there, and periscopes. Stalkers will have our trail by midday.
Mec touches his arm, halts. She points:
Far out, a half dozen FIGURES jog toward them.
MEC
Planetary Guard Cadre. They wear remnants of PAS uniforms.
PAS?
CLOSE
MEC
Peace Assurance Staff ... in orbital habitats. Orbhab residents are on camera at all times. Data collectors continuously record sonic, particle frequency, thermal, and electromagnetic signatures.
CLOSE
What do they want?
MEC
Me. Peace Assurance Staff can locate and stun any resident at any time and send them to The Surface.
Close gives her a perplexed look.
MEC
If PGC can capture me, they will be permitted to keep me until I reach twenty years of age.
CLOSE
How old are you?
MEC
Am ELEVEN.
While she studies at his expression of disbelief, he silently mouthes the word eleven.
MEC
Clones are permitted to live twenty years ... then we are dismantled.
Mec cocks her head.
MEC
You do not believe me. Most humans would kill for sex with any clone.
CLOSE
What were you supposedly cloned from?
MEC
Human and synthetically manipulated genetic material. I am, Close, a genetically engineered male fantasy, but most fantasy holders are far too fearful to indulge themselves.
CLOSE
As far as I’m concerned, even if I swallow your tale, you’re human.
Close unslings the rifle as the PGC draw near.
MEC
No. You must not harm humans. Shall be obliged to stop you. Pre- adolescent psycho-conditioning leaves me no choice.
CLOSE
Bullshit.
When he shoulders the M-16, she snatches it from his hands.
CLOSE
Look, Mec, we hafta—
MEC
They are overweight, but nonetheless malnourished. We shall run. They cannot follow.
Close plops to the sand.
CLOSE
I’m not goin’ anywhere. So ... you gonna let them hurt me?
Mec stares into his eyes, then turns to watch the PGC thugs.
While she’s distracted, Close thumbs several rounds from a pistol magazine. He rises.
Plainly in a quandary, Mec looks back at him. When she again looks to the goggled guards ...
CLOSE
... Throws three nine millimeter cartridges
Mec wheels as he draws the pistol and aims at her leg.
CLOSE
You try to run, I shoot you. I may hafta carry your ass afterward, but without you, I die.
Mec turns back as the missiles stream in ... and Close hits her behind the knees ... tackles her.
Missiles explode behind, in front, and in the center of the pack.
INT. ORBITAL SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
An alarm SHRIEKS.
Image FLOW isolates and stops in front of Seph’s station: INSERT - PANOPTICON SCREEN
Six Planetary GUARDS lie scattered and bleeding around a small CRATER. Another crater behind the men and one in front.
One guard has no head. Another is missing much of the left side of his body. No sound, but two men writhe in pain. The last two show no visible wounds, but are clearly dead.
BACK TO SCENE
GLEEBOK
Night winds no doubt uncovered some ancient munitions.
SEPH
No, Sir. Were that the case, those missiles would have been launched shortly after dawn. Something’s amiss there.
GLEEBOK
Don’t argue with me. Get on with it.
INT. OFFICE - SAME
Thelma Rigby sits at a desk ... watching a monitor. INSERT - MONITOR
Gleebok stalks away from Seph’s station. BACK
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Close follows Mec among the bodies. Near the headless corpse, he finds a pair of two liter BOTTLES full of water. He hands one to Mec.
They guzzle. When Mec surveys the surrounding terrain, Close palms the pistol and shoots both wounded guards.
Mec pivots, hands up, ready to restrain him.
Close holsters the piece. Then continues his search.
MEC
Take goggles. Superior protection.
INT. ORBITAL SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
IMAGERY streams by Seph: She isolates several feet, then places her hands on keyboard spheres and manipulates the images.
SEPH
Gleebok. Quickly!
Gleebok rushes over.
Seph points:
What now?
GLEEBOK
INSERT - PANOPTICON SCREEN
Two GUARDS near each other, in pain but clearly alive. The comparison image: Both have HOLES in their foreheads.
GLEEBOK (OS)
That could be bleeding delayed by shock.
BACK TO SCENE
SEPH
No. Someone other than the MEC killed them. That same someone emptied two water bottles over there and took goggles from that body.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Close spots a plastic bag, pulls it from a guard’s pocket, then scowls at Mec.
CLOSE
I thought you said nobody has meat.
He holds up the bag so Mec can see.
MEC
Among outcasts, other outcasts exist. Rumor is that sometimes outcast families disappear— especially families with children.
Close drops the bag, looks as though he might barf.
CLOSE
Thanks. I really needed to hear that.
Mec appears perplexed.
Close finds three more bottles among the dead guards. He hefts one.
CLOSE
Damned thing feels familiar.
Mec turns him around, takes the containers and loads them into his pack.
MEC
Bottles are more than two hundred years old.
CLOSE
Yeah ... right.
MEC
Do not understand theoretical physics. Do you?
Close shakes his head.
MEC
Then how can you deny that an anomalous occurrence has placed you here?
She pinches his arm.
Ow!
CLOSE
MEC
You are real. You are here. To remain alive, you must start from NOW ... on this sand.
Mec holds out her hands.
MEC
Give me the weapons, please.
CLOSE
No way.
MEC
Could take them, but shall reason instead. I cannot hurt you. Neither can I fight you. You cannot survive without knowledge I possess. Fair assessment?
Close warily nods, studying Mec, clearly seeking an edge.
MEC
CAN run you, Close, severely deplete energy you will sorely need. Then, could easily take the weapons ... and protect you as best I can. I die ... you die.
Close takes his time, unloads both the rifle and the pistol. He stuffs the magazines into the pack and hands it to her.
CLOSE
Are you sure you can get us out of here?
MEC
If we live, then we shall escape. Have plan.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
A caravan snakes across sands and through windblown gullies. Humans, the beasts of burden: RULEBREAKERS, each thin to the point of starvation, each loaded with salvaged steel.
MEC (VO)
Death by Work. Guards supervise hundreds scavenging details, and they always travel in groups of six.
GUARDS in cast-off PAS uniforms: Skinny herders with distended bellies.
A bundle of rusty rebar on the back of a young male PRISONER breaks apart. Rods fall and scatter. The man looks around, visibly scared.
A CLUB clips him under his ear. He drops onto the steel. Other PRISONERS refuse to look.
SANFORD bends, checks the downed man’s pulse.
SANFORD
Reavis! Git this sucka back to tha infirmary.
Sanford winks at REAVIS.
REAVIS
(grins)
I gotta question, Lt. Sanford: you gonna invite me over for dinner?
Sanford winks again.
Another GUARD jogs up, whispers in Sanford’s ear.
SANFORD
Round ‘em up. We move in ten. Take Reavis with you. I’ll git somebody else for this chore.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Mec and Close lie on their bellies among rocks. Below and near a bluff half a mile away ...
CLOSE
(demonstrating)
Shade the goggles with your hands. We don’t need reflections.
... A SPOOR STALKER lopes toward Sanford, Reavis, and four other GUARDS.
CLOSE (OS)
Nobody can be that stupid.
MEC
Sex drives humans. Know the stalker is on my trail. Am the prize.
CLOSE
No. For those morons and that stalker, we are the SURPRISE.
Mec looks his way, sees he’s focused on the stalker. She snatches his knife and rolls away, springs to her feet, then dashes toward the coming melee.
INT. SURVEILLANCE CENTER - SAME
Seph stops a SECTION of vid stream.
SEPH
Gleebok! Now!
When Gleebok arrives, Seph points to Close’s image and enlarges.
SEPH
That man’s signatures are the ones I caught yesterday.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
GLEEBOK (VO)
Where did his clothing come from? Is that a weapon in his hands?
Where the hell is that goddamn clone?
Close takes off after Mec.
CLOSE
No! Mec, stop! Think!
The guards rush the stalker with clubs swinging. One opens a gash on the stalker’s forehead. Others strike at elbows and knees.
The stalker BELLOWS.
A guard SCREAMS, stumbles backward ... holding his escaping intestines both hands.
Down on his side, Sanford swings, connects with the stalker’s ...
ANKLE
... Drawing another BELLOW.
Rage: The stalker swipes, rips out a THROAT. Sanford bangs the stalker’s knee as he rises.
Then comes Mec: Her blade flashes, a long slash that severs the superficial temporal and facial arteries. BLOOD erupts.
But a CLUB thumps Mec above her ear. She drops. Lights out. Reavis yells to another guard.
REAVIS
I got the MEC! I got the clone! I—
A HAND reaches over Reavis’s head from behind. CLAWS pierce his eyes. He SCREECHES. Then the claws dig through the sockets and into his brain.
Another guard goes down. A hairy FOOT works like a scythe. CLAWS rip through facial muscles, then a jugular vein and carotid artery.
HANDS grab Sanford by the head. Massive jaws open and sharp TEETH chew into his face. His screams are muffled in the stalker’s mouth.
The last two guards flee.
The stalker chews into Sanford’s neck, then drops the body.
INT. SURVEILLANCE CENTER - SAME INSERT - PANOPTICON IMAGE FLOW
Close disappears. BACK TO SCENE
SEPH
I lost the image and the signatures. Something is disrupting the energy fields.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
The stalker looks after the fleeing guards, then to ...
CLOSE
... Who stands over Mec, the unloaded M-16 at port arms.
CLOSE
Come on, asshole. Let’s get this done.
Close kneels. When the stalker charges, Close throws a handful of sand into its eyes. He rolls out of its way.
SEPH (VO)
There it is again!
BELLOWING, the stalker paws its eyes.
CLOSE
Yeah, sucker. I fight dirty, an’ blood loss has slowed your dumb ass.
Close rolls back to cover Mec, jams the 16's steel buttplate into a knee. He tries to rise, but the stalker blindly swipes, sinks claws into his shoulder.
Close stoops again while the stalker tries to clear its vision.
Close scoops more sand, throws it between the hairy hands. Then, he drives the buttplate between those hands ... into the stalker’s throat.
Sucking air, the animal spins away, but the damaged knee cannot support its weight. When it falls, Close drives the buttplate into the other knee, then into an ankle.
Close methodically breaks clavicles and smashes elbows. An opening: He slams the buttplate into skull.
Bone CRACKS. Mucus spews from the stalker’s trunk. The beast goes limp.
Close slumps to his knees, gulps a deep breath, then begins shaking all over.
Trembling almost uncontrollably, he crawls closer to Mec, checks her pulse. He mounds loose sand to pillow her head.
Then, gasping, he stretches out beside her. LATER:
Mec blinks. She slowly sits up and looks around: the dead STALKER, the GUARDS, the KNIFE lying in the sand.
She looks down at Close ... eyes his blood-splattered clothing, his bleeding shoulder.
MEC
You fought this stalker? To protect ME?
CLOSE
(deep breath)
You were right about the chemicals in the sand. Lucky he didn’t know that.
(chokes)
S-so d-damn s-scared ... Mec.
She helps him sit up, removes his t-shirt.
MEC
You are fortunate. The wounds are not serious.
She opens a bottle, drops water over several PUNCTURES. CLOSE
Fortunate that you cut the bastard. Later, I’ll show you how to use the handgun. You carry it ... loaded.
We can’t risk fightin’ those damned things.
MEC
No human has ever risked his life for a—
CLOSE
Maybe no human ever realized that you are human. Maybe it’s time I teach the ignorant clods some manners.
Mec daubs the wounds with his shirt.
CLOSE
Thanks.
He pulls another too-large t-shirt from the pack.
CLOSE
We need to eat.
MEC
Two days more. We can search the guards. Need more water. Shelter soon. Two hours.
Close points to a crevice in the bluff.
CLOSE
That work?
At the crevice, Close shucks the pack and his shirt.
MEC
Yes. I saw one guard with a binocular.
CLOSE
I hafta clean up. Get this stink off me.
MEC
No water. Use sand. Avoid the open wounds, and stay in my suit’s field.
CLOSE
Oh, I guess you want to watch.
MEC
No. Help. Trousers. Off.
Mec sits by Close’s head, pressing his t-shirt to his eyes while she scrubs his face with fine sand.
MEC
Same with wounds. Must cover.
When Mec finishes, Close stands, dons sunglasses and uses the shirt to lightly brush away the remaining granules. He looks up just as ...
MEC
... Shucks her suit.
Me, too.
MEC
She lies face down in the sand. Close’s mouth drops open:
From neck to knees, SCARS crisscross Mec’s back: bulging scars, thin scars, thick scars, some faded, some new. Four welts are scabbed.
CLOSE
I think I could have fun killing the man who did this.
MEC
Men. Many men. Some women. Clean, Close. Then, we have time for sex.
CLOSE
No. We don’t.
MEC
You dislike or fear me?
CLOSE
No. But no sex ... until you want sex ... with me.
INT. SURVEILLANCE CENTER - SAME
MEC (VO)
Most female clones are lesbian ... because we far outnumber males, and because we cannot trust humans.
PAS MEMBERS storm into the rotunda and fan out, the LEADER barking orders.
LEADER
On your feet! Let’s go! Let’s go!
MEC (VO)
Most males are confined to pleasure centers for corporate executives, the exceptions being hunters, which are solely males, and used solely against other clones.
One slow TECH gets stunned. She drops to the floor.
LEADER
Move it! Move it! We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way.
PAS troops herd everyone out ... except ... SEPH
... Who stands at her station ... trembling from head to foot.
LEADER
I prefer the easy way.
Thelma Rigby enters, stops before Seph.
RIGBY
Is my message clear?
Seph nods.
RIGBY
This pod is yours to command. Recruit your own staff. Use your imagination. ... But you find that clone and see to its destruction. No excuses.
SEPH
I will.
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
MEC (VO)
Computers threaten severe penalties for failure to dismantle a clone on schedule. Genetic failsafes are engineered-in; may live two months into my twentieth year, then crash into old age and death.
Wind howls. Sand drifts. Dim light seeps through the layer of swirling dust.
MEC (VO)
Many residents tease clones about early dismantling. Owners and pilots use the threat for extortion.
Shivering, eyes closed against airborne chemicals, a STALKER squats beside the stalker Close killed. He contentedly gnaws meat from a thighbone.
MEC (VO)
We are organic learning machines, designed to perform complicated scientific and technical tasks too time-consuming, or too far beneath the dignity of habitat residents.
EXT. CREVICE - DAY
Close emerges from the fissure first. One look, he throws the rifle to his shoulder and SNICKS the safety.
CLOSE
Bullets! I need—
MEC (OS)
Silence, please.
She sidles through the opening, pistol belted at her waist, binocular slung from her neck.
Before them, the stalker sits. He holds a meat-laden femur in a fist ... both frozen, but with no signs of frost.
Close steps behind Mec, opens the backpack. He pulls out an M-16 clip and slams it into the magazine well. He chambers a round, engages the safety and glares at her.
CLOSE
If you’re mad, act like you’re mad. I got lucky yesterday. Luck runs out.
Mec scowls, but says nothing.
CLOSE
Either I’ve earned your trust, or we fight. No middle ground.
Mec shucks the backpack, hands over the remaining magazines. Close lets a sigh escape, grins at her.
CLOSE
I probably would’ve had a better shot against a fresh stalker.
(looks away, embarrassed) Last night, when we were talkin’ about sex ... you never told me if—
MEC
I have never had enjoyable sex with a human.
CLOSE
No. I’ll bet you haven’t. That, Mec, is a cryin’ damn shame ... an’ not your fault.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Mec crawls on all-fours, Close beside her. They rapidly climb a high dune, then, staying below the rim, they use hands to cut sight notches in the sand.
Ever so slowly, they raise their heads for a look-see:
Watched by six GUARDS—who wear colorful clothing over their PAS rags—thirty PRISONERS swarm over the skeletal remains of an ancient building. They salvage anything made of metal.
MEC
Large detail. Guards will have nutrient wafers.
To demonstrate wafer size, Mec holds a thumb and index finger half an inch apart. Then forms a large circle with her small hands.
MEC
Sufficient energy for three days in each. Trade this metal for more wafers at Spaceport.
CLOSE
Why the hell do you talk like that?
MEC
Apologize. Three clones on mining ship. Abbreviated speech becomes habit because seconds are often critical.
CLOSE
Cool. What are the wafers made from?
MEC
Soybeans and chemical sweeteners. Reeducation farms above and below the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.
Close slides down. Rolls onto his back. He gasps, grabs his shoulder.
Shit!
CLOSE
Mec eases down beside him.
CLOSE
So, what do you have in mind?
MEC
I can run, Close ... for short distances, much faster than a spoor stalker. I can steal—
CLOSE
Jesus, Mec. Count the eyes. If the cons don’t rat you out, they’ll give you away by gawkin’ like tourists.
MEC
Suggestions?
CLOSE
You told me you had no blocks against suicide. Lookin’ at your back yesterday, I figured you for about the toughest son of a bitch I’ve ever met. So, how smart are you?
MEC
I cannot allow you to—
CLOSE
Robbery, Mec, that’s what I do. If you don’t help me disarm the slavers, I am goin’ to shoot them.
He raises sunglasses to his forehead, stares at her goggles.
CLOSE
I don’t know how to quit. So you’ll hafta seriously hurt me to disarm me. That’s a no-no. You help, I promise I won’t kill anyone. But we hafta hike back to that bluff.
EXT. BUILDING/DESERT - DAY
A guard, BUELL, straddles a rusty girder, watches prisoners dig in hard ground.
CLOSE (OS)
Why don’t they make knives, kill the guards?
MEC (OS)
Death sentence. No bladed weapons, no technology permitted on The Surface. Sole exception is transport ships.
Buell looks up, wipes dust from his goggles ... and smiles.
BUELL
Fresh ass!
Two figures approach in the distance:
CLOSE
I can’t under ... I ...
MEC
Comprehend the scope of the disaster you see?
Buell shimmies down to his rallying guards.
MEC (OS)
Twelve to fourteen billion humans in 2090. Orbhab quarters were already being built for selected government elite and the extremely wealthy. Drought struck the northern hemisphere.
BUELL
Let’s bring in them two.
The guards fondle clubs ... anticipation.
MEC (OS)
War came with southern hemispheric countries over grain. The United States, the strongest police state, was the last to collapse.
GUARD
Buell, we can’t be leavin’ them prisoners alone.
BUELL
They wouldn’t have tha balls to squawk if you was chewin’ off their titties. Right, Vasquez?
VASQUEZ
(grins)
We could use a little recreation.
A guard nods; another smiles; one raises a fist. When Buell lofts his billyclub, all five cheer.
MEC (OS)
War. Starvation. Chinese, Pakistani, and Indian governments announced that the Russians had a five-year supply of food in Kara, on the Baydarata Bay in Siberia.
The guards form an aisle for Buell.
MEC (OS)
Hundreds of thousands of humans died trekking to Kara in summertime
... and hundreds of millions froze to death when winter arrived.
As Buell swaggers through his men, each pats him on the back.
CLOSE (OS)
Fuckin’ government creeps. They never change.
MEC (OS)
They are coming. I must remind you of your promise.
CLOSE (OS)
You leave the talkin’ to me. Not one word from you.
Eager for action, the guards practically jog behind Buell. When he stops, they run into him.
All gape at the oncoming pair:
Wearing the backpack, M-16 slung over a shoulder, Close could be out for a stroll ... except he carries a stalker ...
HEAD
... By its blond hair.
Mec carries the damaged stalker ... HEAD
... In a similar manner.
Both have a pair of guard’s regulation ... NIGHTSTICKS
... Tucked into their belts.
Mec halts, tosses her head at Buell’s feet. Then Close drops his. Buell stands visibly amazed, but warily eyeing them.
Close and Mec pitch nightsticks into a pile off to the side.
CLOSE
(to guards)
Put your clubs next to ours.
Terrorstruck, Buell’s minions seem unable to move. Close indicates the stalker heads.
CLOSE
We ate their hearts for breakfast this mornin’ ... been savin’ the brains for later ...
Mec slips behind him, has to rise on tiptoes to reach into his pack.
CLOSE
... Learned that from Hannibal Lecter ... but you have food. Less weight to lug.
Close nods to the nightsticks.
Mec drops the gutted guard’s head between those of the stalkers.
CLOSE
We had his and three other hearts for dinner last night. You wanna live, ditch your weapons.
Five nightsticks clatter to the pile. Buell holds out.
CLOSE
Schoolyard tough, huh? I figure you gotta heart about the size an’ about as soft as a pimple ... not much nutrition there.
Close pulls the knife from the packstrap sheath.
CLOSE
But I’ll enjoy measurin’ the damned thing for myself.
GUARD
Buell, that thing hasta be a clone.
CLOSE
MEC-Class, Model 126 dash four. The geneticists got too shaky to make more than four of us. I got away, without psycho-blocks, an’ I nullified hers.
Buell tosses his club.
CLOSE
You in the rear ... give your pack to my partner.
The guard sets his pack on the ground in front of Mec, then scuttles out of Mec’s reach.
She checks the contents ... nods. Close points.
CLOSE
That direction. Run ... till we’re outta sight.
The guards run, Buell in the lead.
MEC
What if the man had challenged—
CLOSE
No nerve, Mec. That’s why he does what he does.
MEC
And the reason you do what you do?
CLOSE
I never looked for a reason. I guess I never liked havin’ the simple-minded tellin’ me what to do.
She shoulders the pack.
MEC
We have food and water. Now, we must let the prisoners see us travel east rather than west.
CLOSE
I think I jus’ gotta small taste of the fear people have of you.
MEC
Serious taste. The human with the pack urinated when you ordered him to come forward. Could smell it.
Mec and Close don’t get far before a near naked Gleebok and his crew of techies cut them off.
GLEEBOK
We were sent here because of that clone.
Dried blood speckles Gleebok’s EARS, BROWS, and NOSTRILS. Bruises cover his face and airborne chemicals have reddened his EYES.
CLOSE
Committed a heinous crime, did she?
Gleebok’s swollen muscles seem deflated.
GLEEBOK
It tried to escape.
CLOSE
No. She escaped. Looks to me like somebody else escaped with losta pretty face jewelry.
GLEEBOK
If we turn in the clone, I can negotiate pardons and big rewards for all of us. We’ll never have to work again!
CLOSE
An’ I’d bet that you’re a real good worker, aren’t you?
Gleebok almost snaps to attention and salutes.
GLEEBOK
Damn right, I am!
CLOSE
Take her. Gleebok looks dumbstruck.
LATER:
CLOSE
Mec, you take one step, I’ll kill this human.
TECHIE
My God! It’s another clone!
CLOSE
(grins at Mec)
Come on, let’s leave these good workin’ slaves to their next chore.
Mec leads Close up a dune, but halts halfway.
MEC
You shocked me ... MEC-Class 126-4. I thought you would kill—
CLOSE
I made you a promise.
She nods, thoughtful, then pushes up her goggles, and removes his sunglasses so she can watch his eyes.
MEC
Why do you help a clone rather than your own kind? Those humans will be blind soon.
CLOSE
You are MY kind, Mec. An outlaw ... you are worth more than a whole planetful of thunks and thuds like those behind us.
MEC
I must think about this declaration. For now ... am pleased.
Mec tugs down her goggles, takes two steps up, but turns back to Close.
MEC
I accept.
CLOSE
Accept what?
MEC
That you mean what you said. I shall endeavor to earn your respect.
CLOSE
Good. I’ll try to earn yours ... an’ you are still one tough son of a bitch.
Mec turns and climbs.
MEC
Am not son. Am female.
Close clambers after her, grins as he ogles her butt.
CLOSE
Yeah, I noticed.
LATER:
Mec uses the binocular to check ahead of them and behind. She lowers the glasses and scans the sky:
A thin streamer of tan-colored CLOUD forms a long, horizontally laid arc.
She pulls Close up by his packstrap ... gets in his face.
MEC
You follow me. Run! Not walk! Not jog! Dustcane comes this way!
She takes off.
No hesitation. Close follows. Mec slows her pace to match his. LATER:
Mec stops and takes cover from the quickening wind behind a wide masonry bridge pillar. Close drops, gasping. A portion of another column pokes through sand sixty yards away.
MEC
Shelter. Now. Help me! She digs in sand next to the column.
MEC
Need deep hole!
CLOSE
N-no. N-not. Th-there. T-toward the bank. This is ... o-old railroad
br-bridge s-support. There’s a maintenance room b-buried here.
They sprint to the next column. He shucks his pack and digs.
MEC
Storm forms over water. Ashore, moisture dissipates quickly. Then high winds pull heavy sand aloft. Will destroy skin in minutes.
Mec encounters wood first ... the top of a thick door. They clear a space.
Get back.
CLOSE
He shreds old wood with M-16 fire, then widens his hole with the buttplate.
INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - DAY
Dim light and howling wind from outside: Ancient tools hang from hooks or lie half-buried in fine sand.
MEC
Storms generate heat. Warm tonight.
Close glances up to the hole in the top of the door.
CLOSE
You’re sure?
MEC
Not comfortable warm. Survivable warm. Wind chill diminished.
CLOSE
How big are the storms?
Close noses around, finds an ancient carpenter’s PENCIL and slides it into his pack.
MEC
Many miles. Wind and sand will scour our trail. If you stay near me, and if my suit does not fail, free of pursuit for hours.
EXT. BONE FIELD - DAY
Dead still. Blazing sunlight and blistering heat.
Sharing soybean cakes and a water bottle, Mec and Close sit hip
to hip on a tiny patch of sand ... surrounded by a thick layer of human SKELETONS.
CLOSE
Helluva place for a picnic.
He makes an encompassing gesture with his arms.
CLOSE
I still have trouble believing this.
Mec turns, studies him from the light-colored mask where the goggles protected her face from the sun.
MEC
In your time, Close, this disaster was a logical outcome of too many humans. Your thunks and thuds should have foreseen these bones.
CLOSE
So, you listen and learn ... pick up old words.
MEC
Content-defined usages. Inflection revealed your guilt.
CLOSE
My guilt?
MEC
Because you have the will, but did nothing.
CLOSE
You’re saying I should have predicted this?
MEC
Yes.
She paws through his pack, extracts the carpenter’s pencil. Then she blackens a spot on a child-sized skull.
MEC
Is black. Does what with heat?
CLOSE
Absorbs it.
MEC
Is carbon. Cee Oh Two: One carbon atom. Big deal, your leaders claimed, manageable problem.
Bullshit, as you say.
Mec replaces the pencil in the pack.
CLOSE
Why is it bullshit?
MEC
Methane molecule: One carbon atom, also. In 2021, more than nine billion humans, billions of animals to feed them, billions more animals employed to amuse them and to assuage their loneliness ... all expelling intestinal gas.
CLOSE
People an’ animals farting killed the Earth?
MEC
No, Close. Propaganda killed Earth; rendered discussing an overly populated planet politically incorrect.
CLOSE
That got by me.
MEC
Seventy-two degrees in room. I crowd people inside. What happens to temperature?
CLOSE
It rises.
MEC
Humans are heat engines. Genius not required to answer question.
CLOSE
And the atmosphere forms the planet’s walls.
MEC
Rulers have no power to minimally alter, much less repeal, laws of thermodynamics.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
Mec and Close climb a low ridge and halt on the top.
In spite of the heat, Close involuntarily shivers as he surveys the terrain:
MEC (OS)
The United States Government learned from Asians; Homeland Security used a similar trick to lure citizens to FOOD DISTRIBUTION POINTS. Humans exhausted themselves.
A field of human bones stretches ahead ... for miles; to the left and to the right ... for miles. Adult skeletons, but many, many children.
LATER:
MEC
Wind uncovers these bone fields. OBS broadcasts vids to warn residents of the evils of humans who espouse the formation of governments.
CLOSE
As if corporations were any better.
Mec and Close hobble through bones, completely surrounded now, unable to take a step and have a foot actually touch sand.
CLOSE
Hussein had this thing about stashin’ American dollars. I thought the information was solid, so I took off for Iraq. The CIA pinched me at the airport, took me to Romania.
MEC
They tortured you?
CLOSE
Off and on for three years ... until I escaped. The yo-yo’s couldn’t believe I was a solitary robber lookin’ for a score.
They climb another rise, up and out of the sun-bleached bones. Close points:
CLOSE
Is that the Mississippi River?
MEC
Is salt water. The Gulf of Mexico. River perhaps one hundred years ago.
CLOSE
Shit! I hate it ... that I’m starting to believe. Mec, do you have any idea what could have happened to me?
Mec opens a bottle, shares with him, then they strike out toward the water.
MEC
Theoretical physicists claim that time is a medium, as in space-time. No evidence for this ... but if true, then you emerged in this time via a phenomenon I would call a Time Rift.
CLOSE
If that’s true, it could still be open. What’s that?
Close points again, to two dark and distant bulges near the horizon.
MEC (OS)
In your time: Millington Naval Air Station.
INT. ORBITAL SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
A male TECHIE plots markers on a screen.
TECHIE
That’s the last.
Seph stands behind the man, Thelma Rigby beside her.
SEPH
Each is a sighting.
Seph points and makes a circular motion.
SEPH
The MEC made a circle, about eighty miles in diameter, then returned to its point of escape ... the Millington Spaceport.
Thelma Rigby purses her lips ... frowns.
RIGBY
Human intel from The Surface is not reliable; it’s purpose is always to curry favor. Rely on the science.
Get PGC and Spoor Stalkers into that area.
SEPH
But PAS troops are ... they might be killed.
RIGBY
Warn no one.
Thelma Rigby pivots and marches out.
EXT. SPACEPORT - DAY
Mec beside Close, bellies to the ground, he studies the layout through the binocular:
INSERT - BINOCULAR POV
CLOSE (OS)
A flat patch of dry ground is a spaceport?
MEC (OS)
Ships make a port, not the PAS troops.
Six black and white uniformed GUARDS walk around two battered- looking ships ... each over a hundred yards long and sixty wide.
MEC (OS)
Believe only one is loaded. Troops sleep inside that one tonight.
Other closed by brain and computer. No entry.
The ships are oval-shaped, and doubled, a twenty foot oval stacked on top of the cargo holds.
CLOSE (OS)
BACK TO SCENE
Brain?
MEC
Need to explain. Talk later. Must work now. Show you after dark ... when we go inside. No pilot. No PAS.
CLOSE
You mean we’re staying OUTSIDE ... after dark?
MEC
You must wear goggles.
CLOSE
And if we don’t get inside?
MEC
We die. Forty-five minutes to one hour. Cannot warm faces, brain will freeze.
CLOSE
And I thought you were gonna be an albatross around MY neck.
MEC
Albatross?
CLOSE
A dead bird in a dynamite poem.
He tugs Mec over onto her back, then props himself on elbows, face near hers.
CLOSE
You have a plan.
Mec points to the far ship.
MEC
Came to surface on that transport. Owner dismantled a MEC. Ship needed work. Sent me. I had suit ready.
Waiting. Two years.
CLOSE
Your enhancements increase your chances of survival in this time. But think about this: in my time, those enhancements would guarantee survival for both of us ... if ... we can find the Time Rift.
MEC
Will think. Can find Rift. But perhaps leads to different time.
Mec reaches up, raises his sunglasses up on his forehead, then raises her goggles.
MEC
Close, are you proposing long-term alliance with a clone?
CLOSE
You’re more or less programmed to protect humans in this era. I see you as my lifeline ... maybe a lifeline for the planet. So, I’m not about to let you go down.
Mec’s expression forms a question.
CLOSE
We fight, Mec. You cover my ass; I cover yours.
EXT. SPACEPORT - NIGHT
Wind drives sand into the air, roars in the process.
Goggled and shivering, Close has both hands tucked into the front of his pants and old shirt wrapped around his head.
He keeps watch while Mec works under one of the ships. When she drops a hatch, he quickly squeezes inside.
INT. SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Mec crowds into the maintenance shaft, pulls the hatch shut, then wraps herself around Close.
MEC
You will be warm soon. Hug tightly.
CLOSE
P-pleasure. D-damned c-c-cold.
Mec tightens her arms around his neck.
MEC
Warm carotid arteries. Difficult passage for you here. Maintenance shafts small ... to accommodate engineers my size.
CLOSE
T-tell m-me about that b-brain.
MEC
Human experiments gone awry. Genetic. Brains weigh five to six pounds ... too much weight for the spine. They are used in ships to directly interact with computers. Must trust you ...
LATER:
Mec sidles through a port into a cargo hold. Scavenged metal bundles cover the floor, each strapped in place, but the bulkheads hold Close’s attention:
MEC (OS)
Bring humans to surface, return to orbit with metal. Three hundred thousand rulebreakers in orbit. Two special factories. They never leave.
Black, composite handcuffs and shackles every two feet.
CLOSE
After I escaped this time, I made myself a promise: that I would kill the next man who put handcuffs on me. No matter how long it took.
INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
Minimal hardware and gadgetry: A panopticon screen runs around the upper edge of the bulkhead. On a turntable, two chairs face forward, but forward could as well be rearward.
Spherical keyboards are attached to swing-arms to accommodate the pilot or co-pilot.
In the center of the deck stands a four foot pedestal with a transparent dome on top.
CLOSE
High-impact plastic, I’d bet.
Mec follows him across the deck.
Inside the bubble in a reddish liquid bath rests a brain—human- shaped, but twice normal size.
A VOICE issues from unseen speakers:
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
MEC-Class Clone number 86-512: You are to institute Process ...
Mec stops in her tracks, her face blank.
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
Eight-ten, forty-six dash four four. Instantly.
One glance at Mec, Close drops to a knee, thumbs the M-16 safety and aims at the pedestal supporting the dome.
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
You will proceed to the infirmary and immediately begin the dismantling.
CLOSE
Hey, asshole! You know what a gunpowder weapon is? I have one aimed at your support mechanism. She moves, you die.
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
Mec-Class 86-512, belay previous order.
Mec remains frozen in position.
CLOSE
How did you know she was here?
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
Weight, stride, Motion Recognition System in the deck.
CLOSE
Release her now.
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
It will kill both of us if I do that.
Close taps the pedestal with the flash suppressor.
CLOSE
Sounds hollow an’ thin, bub. That’s bad ... for you. So, do you know the shutdown signals for all clones?
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
I have complete control.
CLOSE
You can nullify all her blocks? Permanently?
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
Do you not understand the concept of COMPLETE?
CLOSE
I figure you want to live ... somebody with a brain that big would’ve found a way to kill himself. Right?
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
Correct.
CLOSE
So, here’s my deal: You remove all of Mec’s blocks an’ you get to live. You refuse, I kill you, an’ the PAS creeps when they show up.
Close checks on Mec, who has not moved.
CLOSE
Mec weighs maybe a hundred pounds. I carry her to the next ship, explain to the brain there what I did to you, I think he might be cooperative.
Silence that stretches.
TRANSPORT BRAIN (VO)
MEC-Class Clone number 86-512: You are to institute Process ... seventy-seven point three five six dash one.
Mec blinks. Looks around.
Close rises, lightening fast, he slaps at her.
Mec catches his hand with her left, cocks her right fist ... her expression, unalloyed fury.
CLOSE
(smiles) Beautiful.
Mec releases his hand.
CLOSE
Can you fly this thing?
MEC
Can fly ANYTHING capable of flight.
Close wheels, kicks the brain’s bubble and separates it from the support pedestal.
Liquid leaks and electrical sparks fly. When the glass hits the deck, the ...
BRAIN
... Spills out.
Mec watches Close. He slings the M-16 onto the deck, unsheaths his knife, then slices the brain in half.
LATER:
Mec and Close occupy the two chairs, Mec busy with the pilot’s dual keyspheres.
MEC
Why did you kill him? May have been useful.
CLOSE
I can run my own risks ... kill or die. I have no business leavin’ risks for you to run. Your choices, not mine.
MEC
Learning experience for me: That freedom is not merely a useful word to you.
CLOSE
We couldn’t have taken the chance; maybe he had more tricks to use on you.
He studies the co-pilot’s keyspheres but does not touch them.
CLOSE
I’ve been a slave, an’ I don’t like the feelin’.
MEC
Shocked, Close. Several times by you. ASTOUNDED when I realized that I had reacted instinctively to defend myself. For giving me that one instant, I shall be in your debt ... forever.
CLOSE
Maybe we can do better ... than debt.
MEC
Cinch belts.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
An ugly oval ship sets down on a desert plain. The rear port/ramp lowers.
Four PAS GUARDS escort Thelma Rigby and Seph to the ground. They remove handcuffs and shackles, then march back up the ramp.
Rigby and Seph look around, Rigby trembling. The ramp raises and the ship silently lifts.
RIGBY
What do we—
SEPH
Oh, I understand; NOW you want to listen to me. What I do is no longer your concern.
Seph slides a bicep bracelet down her arm. She twists and pulls, and frees a tiny hook-shaped blade.
RIGBY
I cannot permit you to—
SEPH
I am not about to become a sex toy for hundreds of smelly men. You—
RIGBY
I order you to desist! (tears)
You must not leave me alone!
Seph scowls at Rigby, shakes her head in pity. Then, she raises the knife and slices deeply into her own neck.
EXT. ORBIT - DAY
CLOSE (Comlink)
I don’t understand why we couldn’t use the ship we had.
Tethered to each other and to backpacks, two space-suited figures drift away from the battered transport ship.
MEC (Comlink)
Phoenix Habitat Corporation is wealthy. Fields superior equipment. Has ship I want. Clones die on long voyages. Sometimes must be replaced.
CLOSE (Comlink)
I don’t guess you’ve heard the bird-in-hand cliche.
MEC (Comlink)
To initiate genetic alterations requires sophisticated lab. On some ships, brains have knowledge but not means. Quantum computers control the data, but lack awareness.
Light reflects from a distant habitat.
CLOSE (Comlink) Alterations? For yourself?
MEC (Comlink)
Close, I want to live. If I can have one more year, or only one week ... I want those minutes.
CLOSE (Comlink) Is that Phoenix ahead?
MEC (Comlink)
Yes. When time comes to maneuver, you hold onto me, stomach to stomach. No room for error.
The habitat’s metal skin becomes defineable.
CLOSE (Comlink)
Mec, what’s to keep these people from blowin’ us into little pieces?
MEC (Comlink)
My suit. We are invisible ... electronically. Also, neither ships nor habitats have weapons. Weaponry is personal and used solely by Peace Assurance Staff.
CLOSE (Comlink) Cops! No war, huh?
MEC (Comlink)
Profits rule. War became obsolete because it is not profitable from orbit. No plunder. No natural resources.
More LIGHT reflection: A small ship leaves the habitat while another comes in.
CLOSE (Comlink)
What kind of weapons do the cops carry?
MEC (Comlink)
Particle beam handhelds defaulted to stun. Coded to a staff member’s DNA. Resetting to lethal mode requires an elaborate entry code.
CLOSE (Comlink)
Figures.
MEC (Comlink)
To maintain mass-destruction weapons is too expensive. Plus, focus is required. In habitat society, few humans have the attention span to remain angry for longer than ten seconds.
CLOSE (Comlink)
So, distraction is a weapon for us.
A long pause while Mec studies his expression.
MEC (Comlink)
Think I am pleased that you are not angry at me.
INT. HABITAT - DAY
Close has to scuttle sidewise to follow Mec through the maintenance shaft. He carries the backpack in front with one hand, a chore that has him breathing hard. At an exit port, a dull background ROAR fills the tunnel.
CLOSE
Stop. What’s that noise?
Mec touches a button on the bulkhead. A cover slides back on a porthole offering a view through a one-way mirror:
MEC
Humans.
PEOPLE, fifty or so, crowd into a small space. All talk at once
... to each other, into headsets, into handheld devices.
MEC
Multiracial, but monocultural. Old American English mandatory.
Corporation is family. Politically incorrect offenders sent to surface.
She pauses ... studies his expression.
MEC
You seem ill.
CLOSE
I want to throw up, but I won’t. (deep breath)
Before I escaped, I read an old book by Neil Portman called AMUSING OURSELVES TO DEATH. He predicted something similar to this.
MEC
If you wish to rest, we should. We have a distance to go.
CLOSE
An’ I’m gonna be useless when we get there ... too tired if we hafta fight.
MEC
Shall carry packs.
CLOSE
On my Earth, I used to steal cars when I needed to travel ... fix ‘em up to look like police vehicles.
She gives him a blank look.
CLOSE
Mec, in a police state, people avoid lookin’ at cops. Dress like cops, we can go anywhere we want.
Mec slides down the bulkhead ... squats.
Close follows suit, but has to wedge himself sideways to get all of the way down.
MEC
You have no fear?
CLOSE
I have a healthy amount ... which means a great deal ... but I’ll do what has to be done.
Mec studies his face for a long time ... finally nods.
MEC
Discard nonessentials now. I shall locate a PAS locker room.
INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNEL - DAY
Although Mec never ventures more than a few feet from Close, she flits through the conduit where he gets stuck, has to fight for forward progress. She finally stops before a wall of waist-high panels.
MEC
(points)
Need silence now. PAS lockers. Access here so supervisors can search.
One tiny red light blinks a dozen feet away.
CLOSE
What? ... Somebody has a locker open?
Mec nods toward the light, then crosses her lips with her index finger. She taps numbers onto a keysphere.
MEC
(whispers)
Humans unaware clones have access.
CLOSE
(whispers)
So ... you’re trusting me?
She plants hands on hips, turns slightly and looks up at him.
MEC
(whispers)
Close, twice you had a choice concerning this life. I continue to breathe.
Before he can answer, she opens the panel, pulls a jacket through and checks the size against her body, then his. She returns it.
Closes the panel and moves to another locker.
CLOSE
(whispers)
Thanks. I ... I feel ... HONORED.
A gaudy red thing, the next jacket doesn’t swallow him. She slops a matching helmet with a tinted visor over his head, a metal- flake red with gold pinstripes.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Mec and Close walk along a thickly carpeted deck.
CLOSE (Comlink) Why does this feel strange?
MEC (Comlink)
Eighty percent of pseudo-gravity generated by centrifugal force. Ten percent by magnetism. Your boots have metal.
CLOSE (Comlink)
So, I’m stronger than the muscled- up dipshits?
MEC (Comlink)
Muscles for display. Posturing. Not work. Babies.
CLOSE (Comlink) Well, that hasn’t changed since 2021.
A PAS MEMBER observes while two showy, muscle-bound MEN argue.
Visors up, the men stand three feet apart, but lean toward each other, almost face-to-face—like quarreling roosters.
MEC (Comlink)
Carpet dampens sound. Disrupts the frequencies at which refined metals resonate.
MAN
You sleazy piece of shit, don’t you ever ...
Mec and Close pass by.
CLOSE (Comlink) That cliche is garbage from my time.
MEC (Comlink)
American English universal. Frozen. Mandatory after corporations captured Britain and invaded Canada.
CLOSE(Comlink) Muscled-up clowns.
MEC (Comlink)
Human males strive to impress other males. Women enhance buttocks and breasts because they believe they must compete with clones for sex.
CLOSE (Comlink)
Compete? I got news for ‘em: on a beauty scale of one to ten, the one clone I’ve seen is at least a Fourteen.
MEC (Comlink)
All fourteens. Some perhaps, fifteens. Is compliment?
Mec edges away from Close, forcing a pair of PAS TROOPERS to walk between them.
LATER:
CLOSE (Comlink)
Yes, that was a compliment, and your move was slick. Most women would have stepped closer to me.
Mec and Close pass through a narrow, deserted corridor.
Ahead, two PAS COPS enter the passageway, big guys who dwarf Mec.
MEC (Comlink)
When they touch weapons, charge.
CLOSE (Comlink)
But—
MEC (Comlink)
Do as I say.
The second a hand touches a stunner, Mec is on the Trooper, has his arm twisted, and her hand over his ... in control of his weapon.
Close grabs gunhand, knees a crotch, turns the guard loose as the man bends.
Mec zaps Close’s opponent.
MEC (Comlink)
Hold him upright! Must not fall! Body alarm!
She stuns her captive, then slides his weapon back into its holster.
Follow me.
MEC (Comlink)
She holds her guard around the chest, drags him to a maintenance port, then through.
INT. MAINTENANCE SHAFT - CONTINUOUS
Mec wedges the body upright, then helps Close with his.
CLOSE (Comlink) What do we—
She holds up a hand for silence while she compares his physique to that of the guards.
Close draws his knife.
MEC (Comlink) What do you intend—
CLOSE (Comlink)
You told me those weapons are DNA- controlled. I AIN’T goin’ out there again without somethin’ lethal.
Conscious, horrified, the PAS trooper looks on while Close compares their hand sizes.
MEC (Comlink) Close, they are—
CLOSE (Comlink)
Can it. Human nature, Mec: Low class, no class thugs usually claim to be an elite class over skin color, uniforms, or badges. Right now, I need some elite skin to operate an elite stungun.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Hands bound at the back, Mec trudges down the passageway,
escorted by a bulked-up Close in a PAS uniform. They pass orbhab RESIDENTS, but curious gazes never linger.
MEC (Comlink)
You loathe them, do you not?
Close carries the red helmet in his left hand.
CLOSE (Comlink)
That they don’t have the balls to question anything. For all these thunks know, I could be about to roast your ass over an open fire.
MEC (Comlink)
This reminds you of your time?
CLOSE (Comlink)
Same sheep pretendin’ to be human.
MEC (Comlink)
Next intersection, slip my binding so we can drift apart. Then follow me.
INT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
MEC (Comlink)
The two big ships: Automated mining and processing units able to range Solar System. Infrasound to reduce ores to powder. Separation into useful material without energy deficit.
From the orbital habitat, dock wings spear outward—nothing more than an enclosed corridor. Docked to one arm are the two large mining ships and dozens of smaller vessels.
MEC (Comlink)
Run by quantum computer. Staffed by a human, a brain, as many as two to four clones, for maintenance and entertainment on long voyages.
CLOSE (Comlink)
I can’t believe those ports won’t be locked.
Close and Mec stand at opposite ends of the viewing port.
MEC (Comlink)
Only locks controlled by security supervisors who spy on PAS. Small ships private yachts. Residents enjoy SAILING, but panic if they lose sight of habitat.
A pair of PAS thugs enter, scan the deck.
CLOSE (Comlink)
Watch reflections ... so, the meek have finally inherited the earth. The corporations saved deadbeats when the world needed adaptable doers.
Mec tenses, fingers the pistol.
MEC (Comlink)
I see them ... deadbeats afraid to steal ... or to question your presence.
CLOSE (Comlink)
You sure these hacks can’t hear us?
Close turns to check on them.
The men nod to him, then step back through the port.
CLOSE
But you weren’t stealin’?
MEC (Comlink)
Not running from theft. Close, am first clone to attempt escape.
First ... ever.
CLOSE (Comlink)
We’re gonna hafta see that you set a good example for others.
INT. MINING SHIP - DAY
MEC (Comlink)
Ships deliver to and are serviced at habitat ports ... never on surface or near facilities that hold outcasts.
Mec leads Close through the airlock port. She immediately turns and hits a switch.
MEC (Comlink)
From surface, from moon mines, ores and metals are delivered to factories in remote-controlled containers without life support capability.
The entrance ramp rises and shuts with a HISS.
MEC (Comlink)
No one can enter from outside. Know this ship. Two trips. Learned codes. MY ship now.
He holds out his left hand.
CLOSE (Comlink)
Aye, aye, Captain. Let’s do this.
Mec shucks her helmet, then lays the pistol in his palm.
Close sheds his helmet, sets it on the deck, then winks at Mec.
CLOSE
Never would’ve gotten this far without you. I got your back.
Close tucks the pistol under his right arm, then rolls bloody PAS skin off his right hand.
A female VOICE issues from unseen speakers:
MEGA (VO)
MEC-Class Clone number 86-512: You are to institute Process eight-ten, forty-six dash four four, forthwith.
Mec listens, her face blank. Then she awkwardly returns his wink. Close’s mouth drops open:
ISOC and MOC enter, tall, blonde women in cobalt blue coveralls who might be sisters.
MEGA (VO)
Mec-Class Clone num—
CLOSE
Ah, shut up! You speak again, I’ll disconnect your ass ... permanently.
Silence: Four sets of wary eyes scan for danger. Mec turns, nods to them, and smiles.
MEC
Designations?
Close goggles: The women are constantly on point, like Mec, watching, learning ... curious to the extreme.
ISOC
Isoc. Am—
MEC
Am Mec. New pilot-slash-captain. (to Close)
Isoc is Infrasound Operator slash Courtesan.
(to Isoc)
No future sexual duties.
As though silently communicating, Isoc and Moc glance to each other often.
CLOSE
God ... they’d put Victoria’s Secret models outta work.
(to Mec) Couple?
Mec nods to Close, then looks to Moc, does not speak.
MOC
Am Moc.
MEC
(to Close)
Machine Operator slash Courtesan.
Mec marches by the clones.
CLOSE
I’m Close. I’m human. You’re human. No more slave shit. No more courtesan crap.
INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Isoc and Moc stifle grins as they follow Close, who stays on Mec’s heels.
The setup is like that of the transport they stole, but has six work stations. Plus, this layout is so plush it’s decadent.
Another transparent dome sits in the center of the deck, but one decorated with gold flake.
This time Close follows Mec’s lead.
Inside the dome in a reddish liquid bath rests another brain—human-shaped, slightly smaller than the one Close destroyed.
MEC
The last brain I encountered ... but you should know about that by now. How are you called?
MEGA (VO)
Megabrain.
MEC
You are Mega from this point forward, unless you prefer another name.
MEGA (VO)
I shall have you know that I was named by my employer and—
CLOSE
You’re a prisoner now. Live captive, dead meat. Your choice. It would be a real good idea to let me know where you stand.
MEGA (VO)
Live captive.
CLOSE
Great, Mega. First order of business: Mec calls the shots. She can fly this ship, so we don’t need you. That’d be a damn good thing for you to keep in mind.
LATER:
MEC (VO)
(to Close)
You understand freedom; convince her to cooperate. Your job.
INSERT - PANOPTICON SCREEN
The view shows open space, no other ships, no habitats.
CLOSE (OS)
That AIN’T rocket science, girl, just a little applied thought.
GIGGLES. Polite CHUCKLES from Moc and Isoc.
CLOSE (OS)
What the hell’s so funny?
BACK TO SCENE
Mec reclines on the pilot’s chair.
MOC (OS)
Rockets obsolete.
Stripped of PAS clothing, wearing a pair of Isoc’s cobalt blue coveralls and clean, Close props himself against Mega’s pedestal, his elbows on the dome.
CLOSE
My bad. ... So, Mega, I figure if you were truly free, you’d be able to move around freely.
The two clones occupy acceleration chairs ... both listening.
CLOSE
With the technology available, plus corporate resources, somebody, somewhere could have designed a spine capable of supportin’ your extra brain weight.
MEGA (VO)
I am an employee of—
CLOSE
Employee my ass! You are a dumb-ass slave who’s helped slavers enslave these three women. You don’t have sight, but I can assure you that they are human.
MEGA (VO)
I do not have to listen—
CLOSE
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. What you hafta do is this: Part of your job is clone control; so nullify the psycho blocks on these women.
Passive until now, Isoc and Moc seem dumbstruck.
CLOSE
Do it now ... or I’m gonna turn your gray matter into a greasy spot on this deck.
INT. MAINTENANCE SHOP - DAY/NIGHT
CLOSE (OS)
Why don’t you jump into a worm hole an’ disappear? You know ... warp speed ... that stuff.
Mec huddles between Moc and Isoc. The women perch on stools at a work table. Moc has the PAS stunner opened before her.
MEC
Is myth: Faster than light travel. Vast distances. No exploration beyond Heliopause. Since Collapse, no meaningful research in astrophysics. All science chaotic.
Isoc works on a volleyball-sized sphere that appears to be composed of nothing but electronic circuitry.
MOC (OS)
Voyager spaceprobe launched in August 1977. Speed, thirty-eight plus thousand miles per hour. Needs fourteen thousand years more to travel one light-year.
Close hovers, watching and studying, but obviously out of his element.
CLOSE
Three hundred years. So, how fast—
MEC
Two hundred twenty-two thousand miles per hour. Good ship.
CLOSE
Weapons?
MEC
None. Mining tools. Perhaps Ultra- Focus Laser. Constructed for work in dense atmosphere.
CLOSE (OS)
Infrasound. You said so.
Mec scans his expression, as though wondering if she were speaking to the dumbest human in the solar system.
MEC
Must create small atmosphere to use infrasound. If firearm, then pistol, not rifle.
CLOSE
Shit! In other words, we’re hit.
Isoc spins to face him. She points to the sphere.
ISOC
Mec’s idea: Reconfiguring Surface Geological Analyzer to mimic ship’s electromagnetic emissions.
Amplified signal. Will launch near sun, too near for other ships to follow.
MEC
Pursuing ships have no weapons.
CLOSE
I gotta question ... for all of you.
Close looks to each face while he chooses words. His gaze returns to Mec.
CLOSE
I finally get it. Okay? This is 2273 AD. Other than clones, brains, computers, an’ ships, is there anything here worth salvagin’?
MEC
Anticipated implications of question. Chose this ship. Hull designed to withstand sulfuric acid corrosion on Venus. Explain purpose of question to Moc and Isoc.
CLOSE
You’ll always be on the run in this time. In 2021, if we can get there, you can live as you damn well please. Your technology guarantees that.
MEC
You, however, would be the fugitive.
Close shrugs a what-the-hell shrug.
CLOSE
I gotta bad attitude. Cops shootin’ at my ass comes with the territory.
Isoc twists, looks up to Mec. Both glance to Moc.
MOC
(to Close)
WE shall protect you.
INT. CLOSE’S QUARTERS - DAY/NIGHT
Close kicks back on his BUNK, an elaborate double bed hinged to a bulkhead. A polite KNOCK sounds at his port.
CLOSE
Come in.
Moc and Isoc enter.
CLOSE
Welcome. What can I do for you?
Moc and Isoc look to each other, then back to Close.
CLOSE
Isoc, I hafta tell you that your coveralls look better on you than on me.
The women again look to each other, clearly puzzled by his words.
CLOSE
(pats the bed)
I always thought useless weight violated some kind of law in space. An’ that’s gotta be heavy.
He points to the thick carpet.
MOC
Hedonists.
ISOC
Weight important before Vacu-Grav discovery. Not now.
CLOSE
When it comes to physics, I’m the village idiot. You’ll hafta explain vacy-grav.
Not a word from Moc or Isoc. They drop coveralls and step out of them.
Close gulps ... ogles bodies for long seconds before his brain takes over ... then he blinks ... studies the women:
Between Moc’s breasts, a jagged scar runs diagonally from shoulder to hip.
Instant anger: Close almost growls.
CLOSE
What kind ... a right-handed thug with a knife?
MOC
Broken wine glass stem.
Close swallows a lump. His eyes moisten. He raises a hand, motions them to turn around:
More scars. Fresh welts and long bruises on both.
CLOSE
Put on your coveralls.
ISOC
We do not please you?
CLOSE
YOU please me jus’ fine. Hell, I could take you two an’ Mec an’ go steal a whole planet ... an’ sex with you two’d probably turn me religious. But ...
MOC
You fought for Mec. Because she lives, we are free. In your debt.
ISOC
Is Mec-truth. Am eighteen. Two years more. Two years free.
Close silently mouthes the word “eighteen,” then addresses Moc.
CLOSE
How old are you?
MOC
Am eight.
CLOSE
Put your clothes on ... please.
Close takes a deep breath while they don coveralls.
CLOSE
You listen to me; life isn’t about pleasin’ me, or anyone else. It’s about Isoc an’ Moc. You got that?
Moc examines his expression.
MOC
(to Isoc) In love with Mec.
Isoc brings a hand to her mouth ... horrified.
CLOSE
What’s wrong?
Moc opens the neck of her coveralls, fingers the diagonal scar.
MOC
Humans who fall in love with clones do this.
CLOSE
I am not in love ... with Mec or anybody else.
ISOC
(to Moc)
Does not understand self.
INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
Close reclines on the co-pilot’s chair.
Moc and Isoc occupy acceleration chairs at keysphere terminals where Mec stands near Mega.
CLOSE
So, Mega, what you do is this: search that computer; pull out all the stops. She dies, you will die seconds later.
MEGA (VO)
Why do you hold me responsible?
CLOSE
YOU went along with the program. All these women are scarred ... because you an’ those like you went along with the goddamn program!
MOC
Stop! Is slave!
MEGA (VO)
I am not a slave! I am an employ—
CLOSE
(to Moc)
What the hell do you wanna do? ... slap a Support Your Local Sheriff sticker on her goddamn dome!
Mec looks askance at Close, steps to his chair. She bends, gets in his face, then she points a finger and gently touches his chest.
MEC
Slavemaster?
Furious at first, Close suddenly looks contrite—the kid caught with a burning kitchen match in hand.
CLOSE
Mega, please accept my apology ... an’ while you work on extending Isoc’s life, look into ways to build yourself a body.
Awestruck, isoc and Moc look on as Mec backs off.
MEGA (VO)
I shall accept your apology, but both are a waste of time. No clone, no human has survived the necessary gestation period for a Quanta Frequency Transfer.
Mec drops into the chair beside Close.
MEC
Mega is QFT experiment gone awry.
ISOC
Gestation period ten months ... but full consciousness comes in fifth week.
Close is obviously lost.
MEGA (VO)
Neither human nor analog possesses the psychological strength to endure that degree of sensory deprivation. Most opted for death at six to nine weeks. I lapsed into a coma after thirteen.
CLOSE
I’m not all that smart, but I’m quick, an’ I’m good at improvisin’. You women are engineers. Mega’s a big brain hotwired to a bad-ass computer that has damn near all human knowledge on tap.
He looks around ... every face ... then toward Mega’s protective dome.
CLOSE
(to Mec)
You assign grunt work to me to free up your time an’ theirs.
(to Isoc)
‘Cause you are not gonna die! (scowls at them)
You get to work on this. All of you. Every minute you can spare ... an’ that’s a goddamn order!
INT. CLONE QUARTERS - DAY/NIGHT
Austere and cramped: Four narrow bunks folded against bulkheads; a table in the rear with attached seats; a privacy curtain down the center.
Mec, Close, Isoc, and Moc sit at the table.
ISOC
Mec the first free clone. Has sole right to use MEC designation for a proper name.
MOC
No others have earned that right. Isoc and I wish to change our names.
Moc and Isoc rise, then reverently bow to Mec.
CLOSE
(to Mec)
Tell ‘em to cut the slave mentality crap!
(to Moc and Isoc) Straighten the hell up!
The women back away from the table.
CLOSE
You don’t bow down to anybody! Never! Mec had to fight to free herself. You think you gotta free ride comin’? Isn’t happenin’.
Moc and Isoc turn to Mec.
MEC
Think we must learn to be free. Think Close correct. We cannot bow. Must learn to respect rather than fear, and learn never to confuse the two.
Close nods, bows slightly.
CLOSE
First thing:
(to Moc and Isoc)
You wanna change your names, you change them. You don’t hafta ask anyone for permission.
(to Mec)
You are Captain of this vessel. I’m in your cabin. I’ll move. Find a spot where I don’t invade their space.
MEC
Comfortable here.
CLOSE
We need a pecking order that allows us to function. I’m at the bottom of that order, the flunky, b’cause I lack experience in space.
MOC
Cannot give orders to human!
CLOSE
You don’t have a choice. (to Isoc)
You two either tell an’ show me what to do, or I make mistakes ... mistakes that could cripple this ship.
Isoc and Moc again turn to Mec.
MEC
I shall stow my gear in the cabin. (to Isoc)
Lab has storage space. Is flunky now ... Captain in his time.
Mec nods to Close, mimics his slight bow.
CLOSE
Now that that’s settled, where are we goin’?
MEC
Last voyage on this ship, probe discovered gold deposit on Venus. Kept secret because the owner wants to rule orbhab. Larger deposit than any total in Earth history.
INT. MEC’S SHIP/BRIDGE - NIGHT - NINE MONTHS LATER INSERT - PANOPTICON SCREEN VIEWS
The layered surround scan shows swirling brown clouds on the bottom ... with reflected sunlight on the perimeter.
CLOSE (OS)
Can radar find us if we go down into that stuff?
MEC (OS)
Radar is used solely for contour mapping. Ships are constructed radar-proof to avoid confusion on mineral-rich asteroids.
The upper scan tracks four distant lights closing on the ship.
MOC (OS)
Seven miles to surface.
BACK TO SCENE
Close and Mec recline side-by-side. Moc and Isoc prowl, both nervously eyeing the upper scan.
CLOSE
So, all they have goin’ is the ability to hover an’ block our ascent.
MEC
That is not possible.
MOC
Dropped g and d!
ISOC
Speak in complete sentences, please.
No blue coveralls: All four wear tan and brown body suits.
CLOSE
Apologize. Should’ve studied in school.
MEC/MOC/ISOC/MEGA
(unison)
Speak in complete sentences, please.
Mega’s voice interrupts the women’s laughter.
MEGA (VO)
Captain, you are being hailed by Eleanor Rigby, Captain of the lead pursuit vessel.
Now, Close bursts into laughter.
CLOSE
Put her on the screen. No! ... Wait!
He catches himself, looks to Mec.
CLOSE
(still chuckling)
Please excuse my protocol breach, Captain.
MEC
What is humorous?
CLOSE
ELEANOR RIGBY is the name of a song
... from BEFORE my time.
MEC
Mega, let me see this human’s face. Do not power bridge cameras.
Thelma Rigby’s twin: ELEANOR leans over the Captain’s console ... hard eyeing the camera.
In view behind Rigby: Two HULKS—men without facial hair, but with lots of overly developed muscle.
ISOC (OS)
Hunter/Courtesan Class clones. H/CCs are designed for killing MECs. Sexual pleasure secondary function. Humans fear MEC-inspired rebellion.
Isoc and Moc both turn to Mec, then salute.
RIGBY
I assume I’m addressing MEC-86-512.
MEC
Assume whatever you like.
RIGBY
You are responsible for my sister’s exile.
Mec stares at the upper screen.
RIGBY
I have leave to extend your life and the other clone lives by ten years. I intend to do just that ... before presenting you as gifts to the outcasts on The Surface.
Isoc and Moc glare at the screen IMAGE. Resolute ... ready for a fight.
RIGBY
You will share Thelma’s fate.
Close again looks to Mec.
CLOSE
Thelma Rigby?
MEC
... Surveillance Director for televised fugitive hunts.
CLOSE
Permission to speak to this dumb- ass cop.
MEC
Activate cameras, Mega.
CLOSE
I’m gonna have somethin’ to say about what you do or don’t do with my friends.
RIGBY
And you are?
CLOSE
Doesn’t matter ... not to a dead woman.
MEC
Mega, sever link! (to Close)
Are you insane? ... To threaten a human who has had nine months to prepare for our—
CLOSE
Mec, I’m gonna kill her.
INT. RIGBY’S SHIP/BRIDGE - DAY
A layout exactly like Mec’s pirated craft, but more functionally furnished.
NINETY-SEVEN, a tiny MEC-86 with Eurasian features, occupies the pilot’s chair.
Nearby, SIXTY-ONE, another MEC with black skin, stands as though guarding Ninety-Seven.
RIGBY
(to Ninety-Seven)
When we near that ship, you will mesh Vacu-Grav fields. Forewarned, you will be able to correct and avoid collision.
NINETY-SEVEN
Pardon me, Captain, but in weak gravity of space, MEC-86-512 best pilot alive. Will have ample time to recover.
RIGBY
Then we shall try the maneuver near The Surface.
Rigby seethes.
NINETY-SEVEN
Fugitive ship contains one human, perhaps more. Am not permitted to risk human life. Certainly not permitted to endanger Captain’s life with intentional collision.
RIGBY
And if I turn you over to them?
Rigby hooks a thumb toward the Hunters. Sixty-One sets her feet, goes on point.
NINETY-SEVEN
Therefore, with all due respect, compliance with your order is impossible for me.
EXT. EARTH/TENNESSEE RIVER BASIN - DAY
The green-black HULL of the fugitive ship emerges from the dust cloud. The craft leaves an oval-shaped HOLE that rapidly closes as dust swirls into the pressureless void.
INT. FUGITIVE SHIP/BRIDGE - DAY
As the Western Hemisphere slowly rotates out of solar light ... INSERT - PANOPTICON SCREENS
... The SCREENS clear ... the bottom revealing a narrowing view of limestone bluffs as the ship descends.
BACK TO SCENE
Mec approaches the screens, points.
MEC
That is the cliff where you appeared.
CLOSE (OS)
How do you know? It looks similar to me, but I can’t be sure.
MEC
Accustomed to extrapolating views from various angles. Pilot work. Dustcane reshaped basin floor, but large landmarks same.
(to Mega)
Mega, deflection shield out, then extend limited vacuum field to fifteen feet below ship. Maintain this altitude.
EXT. TENNESSEE RIVER BASIN - DAY
MEGA (VO)
Affirm, Captain.
Suddenly, vacuum sucks fine SAND into the air, around the HULL and upward.
Above the craft, a high PARABOLOID fills with dust, which as though inside a transparent pipe, streams toward the cloud.
INT. FUGITIVE SHIP/BRIDGE - DAY
Mec points to a frozen image on the lower screen: INSERT - SCREEN
First to appear is the exposed SKULL of the spoor stalker Close shot, then the little patch of rocks.
BACK TO SCENE
MEC
(to Close)
I stood there. You were six feet in front of me.
(to Mega)
Mark, Mega, then, calculate the arc. Close must have followed to land there. You have controls.
Close leans forward in the pilot’s chair.
CLOSE
Jesus Christ, that’s a human skull.
MEGA (VO)
Affirm, Captain. Maneuvering and extending laser and sonic probes.
Isoc and Moc don wraparound headsets.
EXT. TENNESSEE RIVER BASIN - DAY
A probe telescopes from the nose of the ship. A dark green BEAM leaps outward from the tip, and slowly tracks up the dust-covered cliff face ... but then also tracks laterally in small increments.
ISOC
I have it. Correct probe straight upward one half degree. There ... zero sonic return.
The laser BEAM disappears ... seemingly into the atmosphere.
MEGA (VO)
Following beam, Captain.
The ship eases forward ... until half the probe vanishes.
MEC (VO)
Rift status, Mega.
MEGA (VO)
Sensors cannot determine. Seems stable. Limited data. Assessment, unreliable.
MEC (VO)
Hold position, Mega. Time to confer.
INT. FUGITIVE SHIP/BRIDGE - DAY
As Mec leans against her console, Moc points to the center screen:
INSERT - SCREEN
Four SHIPS surround and attempt to pin them to the bluff.
CLOSE (OS)
What should—
ISOC (OS)
Deportation penalty for landing on The Surface—a rule no pilot dares violate.
BACK TO SCENE
MOC
Vacu-Grav prevents assault from above.
Why?
CLOSE
MOC
Ship like liquid in vertical tube; a bubble rises to point of equalized pressure.
MEC
Two fields touched after Vacu-Grav discovery. Prisoner transport ships. No survivors.
Close unfastens a pocket on his chair. He removes the pistol, rises and tucks the weapon into a body suit pocket.
On the upper screen’s STREAM:
INSERT - SCREEN
White limestone cliff—clean limestone—no desert dust. Toward the top of the bluff, oak BRANCHES and green LEAVES.
BACK TO SCENE
On the lower view:
INSERT - SCREEN
A wide expanse of flowing WATER. BACK TO SCENE
Isoc and Moc goggle.
MOC
(whispers) Is not possible.
MEC
Then Close is not possible. Situation not possible.
Isoc shucks her headset, grabs Moc by the hand.
MEC
Time for decisions: May NOT be Close’s time ... though could be similar. Go ... or stay?
CLOSE
This is YOUR ship, Mec.
MEC
Shared work. Shared danger. OUR ship. OUR cargo. OUR lives. OUR freedom.
Close points to the upper image stream.
CLOSE
Our world.
MOC
Question for Mega: Can ship sustain Vacu-Grav field through Rift?
MEGA (VO)
Unknown without intense study. Perhaps unknowable.
Close thumps his chest, then taps the top of his head.
CLOSE
My system also works on electricity
... if that matters at all. But it doesn’t look like we have room to turn or get up that cliff.
ISOC
Atmosphere. Can detach and slide cliff under ship. Is risky.
MOC
I say run risk.
MEC
Agree.
Go for it! Concur.
Mega?
CLOSE ISOC MEC
MEGA (VO)
I ... have a vote?
CLOSE
You’re one of us.
During a long silence, eyes glance to Close, clearly seeking reassurance.
MEGA (VO)
Isoc, cut path.
ISOC
(deep breath)
Before I cut rock, and perhaps die, I wish to thank Mec and Close—
MOC
... Also me ... for this taste of free life.
CLOSE
Captain, we need to hold off till sundown. If this is 2021, people may be fishing on the river.
MEC
Your command, Captain Close.
As though to emphasize the order, Mec circles to shoo him from the pilot’s chair.
CLOSE
Old files, Mega: We can hide the ship at the bottom of Chamberlain lake in northwestern Maine
—Piscataquis County, I think.
EXT. TENNESSEE RIVER BASIN - DUSK - PRESENT DAY
On the far bank, GROVER SIMPSON (50s) sits in a rowboat watching three fishing lines while he nips at a pint bottle. When he swallows, his face squinches and his mouth opens to vent volatile fumes, then he gawks:
On the other bank, the fugitive SHIP, black and round, noses out of the water. A white cloud rises above it.
While Grover blinks to clear his alcohol-blurred vision: Under the CLOUD, the ...
CLIFF
... Gently slides into the river.
EXT. TENNESSEE RIVER BASIN - DAWN
A ragged, thirty degree slope extends upward from the water on top, a two-acre plot leveled: Massive trees cut off the ground.
JANINE LYNN (VO)
... Bizarre scene on the Tennessee River near Perryville. Grover Simpson witnessed the event last evening. Grover, could you please tell our viewers what you saw?
TECHNICIANS in biohazard suits scan the ground with assorted instruments, sift debris, and scoop samples into plastic containers.
EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME
Grover has no eyes for the eye-pleasing JANINE LYNN. He stares at the microphone as though she holds a tarantula under his nose.
GROVER
Wal, that spaceship come rahght up outta tha river! I seen it! Nary a sound! Hit turnt that bluff ta dust an’ climbed rahght up it!
JANINE LYNN
You’re certain this was an aircraft?
GROVER
One o’ them UFOs ... went through that cloud o’ white dust ... it did.
JANINE LYNN
Thank you, Mr. Simpson. That was Grover Simpson, a local farmer who was fishing at the time ...
EXT. CHAMBERLAIN LAKE - DAWN
The fugitive ship slowly sinks into calm, clear water.
JANINE LYNN (VO)
UFO aficionados have gathered in droves to camp around this Tennessee site.
INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - DAY
Banana splits, cones, and assorted dishes ... all being dragged
and pushed back and forth over the table under Close’s nose; Mec, Moc, and Isoc gleefully sample each other’s flavors.
JANINE LYNN (VO)
Geologists who examined the cliff believe the limestone simply fractured and slid into the river.
EXT. ZOO - DAY
Plainly disgusted and angry women follow Close from cage to cage.
JANINE LYNN (VO)
Fugitive Roble Close leaped from this very cliff and vanished nearly a year ago. When asked if there was a suspected connection between the two events, an FBI spokesperson laughed.
INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
Laughing, Close shakes his head and restrains Mec, who opens wide to bite into a whole cantaloupe.
JANINE LYNN (VO)
... Informed me that Mr. Simpson regularly and unsuccessfully treats the county jail as his personally rehab facility.
EXT. CHAMBERLAIN LAKE - DAWN
Mec, Close, Moc, and Isoc shiver and splash in frigid water.
JANINE LYNN (VO)
... Topside, sheared and twisted trees lead investigators to believe a small, abnormally powerful tornado touched down ...
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Isoc, Mec, and Moc gather around a writing table where Close unloads a cheap briefcase ... three nine millimeter pistols and extra magazines.
CLOSE
Not weapons I would choose, but none of the pushers had .45s or rifles. The best I could do in this town.
Close places two boxes of ammunition near the clips.
CLOSE
Not enough ammo for practice, but—
ISOC
Surface dwellers speak in complete sentences.
CLOSE
(deep breath)
We don’t have enough ammo for decent practice sessions, but I can show you some basics.
INT. FUGITIVE SHIP - DAY
Close occupies the Captain’s chair, watching Isoc, Mec, and Moc gaze at the lower screen, where:
INSERT - SCREEN
FISH swim by in dim light. Mega’s voice breaks the spell.
MEGA (VO)
Detect atmospheric reactions to Vacu-Grav. Rigby followed.
BACK TO SCENE
Mec cuts her eyes to Close.
MEC
Confrontation inevitable, Roble Close ...
Obviously perplexed and wide-eyed, Isoc and Moc turn to study Mec.
MEC
... Cannot survive Hunters and MECs. You must kill Rigby ... first and quickly. Should you fail, the MECs will be compelled to protect her.
CLOSE
Why did you use both my names?
MEC
You can do this?
CLOSE
I’ll nail the Hunters.
MEC
Once Rigby is dead, the MECs must help me kill the Hunters, or die with me.
Close grits, glares at Mec.
CLOSE
I’m gonna object to that ... strenuously—
She glowers right back.
MEC
You are too slow. NOT injured spoor stalkers, Roble Close. Faster by far. Muscle and bone extremely dense ... designed as armor.
Projectiles may not penetrate sufficiently to ... you stay back. Use your firearm ... and mine.
ISOC
Trusting you with her life ... ALL our lives.
Moc lifts her Tec-9 ... by its barrel.
MOC
Shall—
CLOSE
Guard this ship ... with Isoc. If we lose this ship ... we lose all. I go to jail ... then the U.S. Government will turn you into laboratory animals.
Close looks from Moc to Isoc and back. He patiently waits.
MOC
Affirm, Captain.
ISOC
Affirm, Captain.
Neither woman looks happy about the order.
MEC
Understand your anger, but—
CLOSE
You’ll get your fight. We’re gonna be at war with a while goddamn planet.
INT. RIGBY’S SHIP - DAY
The Hunter/Courtesan Class clones dwarf Rigby as she issues threats to Ninety-Seven and Sixty-One.
RIGBY
I can promise immediate dismantling
... for all of you ... if you fail
...
EXT. CHAMBERLAIN LAKE - DAY
A goose-bumped Close shivers while he washes his head in shallow water.
In the woods beyond the rocky shoreline, Mec and Moc examine insects on the south side of a tree trunk.
Close wipes his eyes ... scans south:
Far away, but over in water, a mining SHIP hovers above the lake.
CLOSE
Mec! You and Moc stay under cover! Rigby’s comin’ this way.
MEC
Must move our ship! Quickly!
CLOSE
No. They’re a long way away. If I can ease into—
MEC
COMPUTER will match your face! Must—
INT. FUGITIVE SHIP/BRIDGE - DAY
Mec and Close huddle with Moc and Isoc.
CLOSE
Mega ... play an imagination game with me: Pretend you work for Rigby. She orders you to develop a means to track this ship. How do you complete that task?
MEGA (VO)
Obsolete premise: You have been seen and identified. Therefore—
MEC
Yes.
CLOSE
YES. What?
MEGA (VO)
Rigby will land, but will fear hiding in water. Hunters can track at night ... on The Surface ... my time. She will send them to capture you. Brain will advise her that Mec will attempt rescue.
CLOSE
How can the brain assume—
MEGA (VO)
Exo-Thermic, -Kenetic, and -Sonic Inflections. Body language ... in this era. I know that ship’s brain. He lived during The Collapse.
Nelson Will. Sentimental and predictable.
MOC
Not assumption. ROBLE CLOSE is term of endearment.
Isoc grins at Moc, then turns to Close.
ISOC
If I say MOC FOUR TWENTY in quiet moments?
MOC
I understand that ISOC SEVEN FORTY- ONE treasures the still moments shared with me.
ISOC
(to Close)
Mec independent. Fierce. When in danger ... wants YOU at her side. No other.
Close turns to Mec ... who studies his face for long seconds ... then nods.
CLOSE
That’s a heavy load to think about. Okay ... the Hunters may be faster, and smarter, but movin’ through a northern forest takes experience they don’t have.
(to Moc) Can you—
MOC
Can reconfigure geological radar probe to track Hunters.
CLOSE
If you can do that ...
MEC
As we were, Rigby will be terrified of water. Can use?
CLOSE
No. We don’t want to FIGHT these people ... just kill them.
INT. RIGBY’S SHIP/BRIDGE - DAY
Rigby springs to her feet:
The second Mec and Close rush through the port.
Close instantly opens fire on the Hunters, who merely flinch as nine millimeter rounds punch into the CHESTS.
Mismatches: As Mec sprints by Close, nine millimeter lead rips CHEEKBONE from a Hunter’s face. Seemingly oblivious, he stalks forward to engage Mec.
Unable to fire in Mec’s direction, Close pumps round after round into the other clone:
Tears away an EAR and leaves a deep GOUGE in its skull. The man shakes his head, as though to dislodge a gnat.
Close wheels, simply puts his last round dead center under Rigby’s nose, then ejects the magazine from the Beretta.
A male voice (NELSON) booms from the speakers.
NELSON (VO)
Brain function has ceased for Captain!
The two MECs race by while Close slams a magazine into the Beretta. He wheels back seeking another target ... in time to see a Hunter throw Mec.
The MEC clones attack the Hunters as ... MEC
... Slams into a bulkhead. Limp as a rag, she drops to the deck.
Close fires four rounds into the other Hunter’s head. The fifth finds entrance through an ear.
The big clone collapses into spasms. Close rushes forward.
The remaining Hunter has Sixty-One on the deck, punching her while he fights off Ninety-Seven with his other hand.
Close moves, tries to get off a shot without hitting one of the women. Instead, he catches a massive fist in his ribcage. Bone SNAPS. Air GUSHES from his lungs. He drops the pistol and backup magazine.
Ninety-Seven lands solid BLOWS that have zero effect ... other than distraction.
Close blinks, spots ... MEC
... And grits. He grabs the pistol ... lurches to his feet.
The Hunter snatches Ninety-Seven by the arm, pulls her in, then slams a fist into her ribs. Several bones SNAP.
Close grabs the hunter’s skull, jerks backward, jams the Beretta
... BARREL
... Into the clone’s bloody ... EYE
... Pulls the trigger. Internal pressure pops the other ... EYE
... From its socket.
Close drags the body off Sixty-One. Then, he pivots ... can’t get to Mec quickly enough. He kneels beside her.
She’s out, bent in a way that leaves no doubt her spine is broken just below her ribcage.
Close checks her pulse, then calls the MECs.
CLOSE
I know you’re hurt. Get her to the infirmary. Now!
He rises, wobbles toward the brain’s life support pedestal.
CLOSE
Nelson Will. You can die now, or you can contact Mega and put her on your comlink.
NELSON (VO)
I am hailing Megabrain.
MEGA (VO)
Close, are you—
CLOSE
Mec is on the way to this ship’s infirmary. I know brains don’t feel pain. But I will slowly cut Will into small pieces and feed him to the fish if he lets Mec die.
Convince him, Mega.
INT. INFIRMARY - DAY
When Close staggers in, the two MECs have Mec in a capsule. In
obvious pain, they nonetheless work nonstop ... a clear reverence for MEC-512.
Names?
CLOSE
The black woman straightens.
SIXTY-ONE
Am called Sixty-One. Close looks to the Eurasian woman.
NINETY-SEVEN
Called Ninety-Seven.
CLOSE
Am Roble Close. Mega, is Mec stable?
MEGA (VO)
Stable ... but, Close, she has massive, irreparable spinal damage.
CLOSE
Ship command is yours. I need—
MEGA (VO)
You trust me to—
CLOSE
I need Moc and Isoc here at dusk to transfer Mec to your ship.
Over shoulders, both MECs stare at him, looking hurt.
CLOSE
We have bodies to get rid of; two women who need ...
He arcs a brow at the women.
NINETY-SEVEN
As you, fractured ribs.
CLOSE
Mega, how long to treat us?
MEGA (VO)
Six hours to render you functional. Less than half that for any MEC.
CLOSE
Isoc stays here to help me. These woman return with Moc ... to help care for Mec. I want a comlink open so I hear the instant Mec is conscious.
MEGA (VO)
Affirm. Captain Close, Nelson Will is trustworthy and will cooperate.
CLOSE
Tell him to remove the psychological blocks from these two women.
Close makes a turning motion with his hand.
CLOSE
Lower coveralls to your waists.
Their backs are covered with fresh whip marks ... torn open during the brawl, and bleeding.
CLOSE
Okay. Sorry. But I had to know.
The women turn again to study Close, plainly wary.
CLOSE
Mega, you and Moc treat their backs as well as their ribs.
NELSON (VO)
The women are busy at the moment, Captain Close. The instant they can spare a moment, I shall free them.
CLOSE
Are you suckin’ ass?
NELSON (VO)
According to Mega, you and I have much in common ... we like girls.
CLOSE
I’ll take you at your word AFTER you treat Mec. Meantime, she dies, I’ll do exactly as I said I’d do. For now, I can help. So tell me what to do, and let’s start with fixin’ these women.
NELSON (VO)
You may not have forgotten the Age of Chivalry, but sensors tell me your injuries are more severe.
CLOSE
That doesn’t count. They can become functional faster than I can.
EXT. CHAMBERLAIN LAKE - DAY
Holding hands, Moc and Isoc stroll along the shoreline listening to Close finish his spiel.
CLOSE
You could Isoc ... no question about that.
ISOC
(looks to Moc) Will you—
Moc raises a fist ... thumb up.
MOC
Will reconfigure tank.
INT. FUGITIVE SHIP/INFIRMARY - DAY
Mec opens her eyes to find Close holding her hand and the newcomers hovering. Three relieved smiles welcome her to consciousness. She looks to Ninety-Seven.
MEC
Pilot?
NINETY-SEVEN
(slow nod)
Ninety-Seven. Am honored.
Mec looks to Close.
CLOSE
Captain, now. This ship. (to Sixty-One)
Are you a pilot, too?
SIXTY-ONE
Ninety-Seven far more skillful.
Sixty-One almost bows to Mec.
SIXTY-ONE
Sixty-One. Am likewise honored.
CLOSE
Captain Sixty-One. Rigby’s ship.
MEC
Will die soon. Can feel energy dissipating and—
CLOSE
Ain’t happenin’, Mec. We can—
MEC
Cannot survive gestation, Roble Close.
When Mec calls him by both names, the women immediately cock heads to study them.
MEC
Too inexperienced, too little psychological grounding to endure ten mouths’ sensory deprivation.
CLOSE
I had already decided to take Isoc through gestation ... to make sure she survives ... and I had already planned on accompanying you when your time came.
SIXTY-ONE
Cloning possible because no awareness involved until last week of gestation.
CLOSE
One tank. The three of us will go together ... not to worry, Mec. I got this.
NINETY-SEVEN
Human dream: Immortality. Second life. Not possible. All who tried opted for death. The strongest endured a few weeks.
Close fearfully glances at Mec, who accepts Ninety-Seven’s brutal observation without sign of fear.
CLOSE
(sighs)
I was a stone cold loner when the CIA shipped me to a Romanian prison: sole contact with guards during torture. No reading material. No outside contact. No light. I talked with mice I could hear but couldn’t see.
MEC
How long?
CLOSE
Three years. I went to Iraq to rob a crooked clerk in the Ministry of Finance. The CIA thought I was a spy.
Mec shifts her gaze to Sixty-One.
CLOSE
Hey, I got this.
MEC
(to MECs)
Is difficult to understand right now ... but this human is like none we know. He will fight ANYTHING to protect you and others on these ships.
MEGA (VO)
Does this include Nelson Will?
Close turns to Ninety-Seven and Sixty-One, his expression a question.
MEGA (VO)
Nelson Will was alive, in human form during Collapse. Valuable insights.
CLOSE
Captains, answer the question.
SIXTY-ONE
Ship of pain ... the Rigby ship is called. MECs seldom live one year without dismantling.
NINETY-SEVEN
Nelson Will provided medical care in ship’s infirmary ... against orders, against corporate policy. Also treated H/CCs after sex sessions with Rigby sisters.
SIXTY-ONE
Either sister would have dismantled him.
CLOSE
Conference. Here. Tonight. Everybody comes. Nelson Will included.
LATER - NIGHT
Mec lies on a bunk, from diaphragm down, her body encased in a heavy-duty, clear plastic BAG that seems to breathe.
MEGA (VO)
... To precisely reestablish each subatomic particle’s frequency.
Thus, a growing brain reorganizes memory into already familiar patterns ... in addition to enhancing function and capacity.
Ear cocked and listening, Close sits beside the bunk, again holding Mec’s hand.
NELSON (VO)
Your suggestion with music has been tried, Captain Close. It failed.
Moc holds Mec’s other hand, while Isoc, Sixty-One, and Ninety- Seven listen and hover like hens over a nest.
CLOSE
We’re talkin’ about engagin’ minds in social animals who won’t be able to speak to each other. Music wasn’t tried with enhancements for that, for math, and for languages on brains working to engage each OTHER.
NELSON (VO)
That is new, however—
MEC
Want Isoc and Close enhanced to MEC Class specifications.
ISOC
Life expectancy ... if we survive.
MEGA (VO)
In Earth gravity, one hundred to one hundred fifteen active years.
NELSON (VO)
(emphatic)
You MUST survive! Mega and I are experimenting with the Hunter-Class skulls ... to develop brainpans, so to speak. Someday, if Mega permits, I would love to frolic in her undergarments.
Dead silence. Then Ninety-Seven and Sixty-One burst into laughter—the first heard from either.
When Mec joins in ... the others follow.
MEGA (VO)
I extend that invitation now.
LATER:
Close and Mec alone: He paces, counts off items on his fingers.
CLOSE
Invasion of government computers to create deep ID’s for each of us; virus under construction; cargo stashed on dark side of the Moon and poured into ingots; and gestation is a go.
MEC
Roble Close ... do not attempt this.
He halts ... scowls.
CLOSE
Mec, I’ll come out of this with different DNA, fingerprints, and retinas ... and I’ll be smarter to boot.
Mec opens her mouth to speak, but he holds up a hand to stop her.
CLOSE
Look, I know you believe you’re some kind of mock human, but—
MEC
Analog is word.
Close sits, takes her hand.
CLOSE
Bullshit. You are the most complete human being I know, that I have ever met. That means TOUGH, Mec ... and tough gets us through gestation.
MEC
Dissuading you not possible?
CLOSE
I never expected life to be this good because I grew up around weak people. Am surrounded by strong people now.
MEC
Isoc will—
CLOSE
Is gonna need you to be as tough as she is. So am I. Am scared, Mec.
She squeezes his ... HAND.
MEC
Go. Must speak with Mega.
LATER:
Mec drinks through a straw, then passes the container to Isoc.
MEC
Afraid?
The woman’s expression says words cannot describe the fear.
MEC
Mega? Risk assessment.
MEGA (VO)
Captain Close is x factor. Skews results. I believe he assures success ... one hundred percent.
MEC
But?
MEGA (VO)
You had zero chance of escape. You escaped. Zero chance of surviving hunt. You are here. Zero chance to survive Hunter-Class clones and MECs. You are here.
MEC
You trust Roble Close?
MEGA (VO)
Did not state such. I BELIEVE he can complete task.
ISOC
In love with Mec. Love strong.
MEC
May also be in love, Mega. Must discuss this.
(to Isoc) Excuse us, please.
INT. FUGITIVE SHIP/LABORATORY - NIGHT - NINE WEEKS LATER
Sixty-One, Moc, and Ninety-Seven crowd around the gestation TANK.
MEGA (VO)
Captains, Moc, encephalous activity spiking in Isoc embryo. Normal range.
Ninety-Seven lays a hand on Moc’s shoulders where Sixty-One loops an arm around her waist.
Mesmerized, Moc can’t pull her eyes from the tank.
MEGA (VO)
Close embryo spiking. Normal range.
Inside the TANK, three well-developed EMBRYOS float in light red fluid. Each has an umbilicus attached to a plastic junction BALL
... into which many tubes carry nutrients, meds, programming data.
NINETY-SEVEN
Status on Mec.
MEGA (VO)
Nothing yet.
SIXTY-ONE
Mega, check her—
MEGA (VO)
Excuse me, Captain. AM checking ... constantly.
SIXTY-ONE
Accept apology?
MEGA (VO)
Apology NEVER necessary, Captain. All anxious. All want to succeed
... Isoc aware ... Mec spiking.
Ninety-Seven places both hands on the glass, as though offering a prayer.
MEGA (VO)
Captain Close aware. Mec spiking beyond normal range ... dropping
... return to normal. Is conscious.
NELSON (VO)
Mega, you should do the honors.
Notes from Rachmaninoff’s ETUDE TABLEAUX IN A MINOR flood the lab.
