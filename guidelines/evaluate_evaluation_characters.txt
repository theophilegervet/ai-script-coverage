2. Grade. Difference from the reference.

3. Quantitative evaluation. 
3.a. Reason for your grade.
3.b. Grade. Assign a grade of 0 if the grade difference from the input to the reference is 2 or more on the scale (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent), for example, Excellent to Fair or Recommend to Pass, or if all comments are missing or in disagreement with the reference.
