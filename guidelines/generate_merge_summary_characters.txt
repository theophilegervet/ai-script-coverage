Your output should be a JSON with a single "data" key mapping to a list of characters following the input structure. Remove any duplicate information while retaining all information. Sort characters by order of importance: first Lead, then Supporting Lead, and finally Supporting. If characters have two ages (usually because of flashbacks), pick the biggest (most recent) one.
