A review should contain the following sections in order in a JSON:

1. Genre. Difference from the reference.

2. Period. Difference from the reference.

3. Location. Difference from the reference.

4. Quantitative evaluation. 
4.a. Reason for your grade.
4.b. Grade. Count aspects for which there is a major difference from the input to the reference (for example, "Present, 1995, and Late 1980s" vs "Late 1980s to present day" does not count as a major difference). Assign a grade from 0 (major differences everywhere) to 3 (no major differences).
