SAM DAWSON (40s) is a single father with the intellectual capacity of a seven-year-old, raising his daughter LUCY (1 when introduced) with a pure and unconditional love. When Lucy is born, SAM's partner, BECCA (30), abandons them, forcing Sam to rely on his neighbor ANNIE for guidance on how to care for his newborn. As Lucy grows, they develop a special bond; he introduces her to movies and celebrates milestones like her first birthday haphazardly caught in a photo booth at Walmart, where he works. Sam's life is hindered by everyday challenges and moments of anguish, like when he mistakenly gets arrested for solicitation with a friend, LILY. He manages his days with the loving support of his group of friends, IFTY and BRAD, who help him navigate fatherhood. Sam's world pivots when he learns that his intellectual limitations might become a barrier to Lucy's growth when she starts surpassing him intellectually, throwing Sam into a spiraling fear of losing her.

SAM's fears come to life when the state intervenes, questioning his capacity to care for LUCY as she outgrows his mental abilities. Amidst the legal turmoil, Sam accidentally kidnaps Lucy from a protective service agency, which complicates his situation further. He seeks out a high-powered attorney, RITA HARRISON, who initially agrees to take his case pro bono to prove a point to her colleagues but soon becomes personally invested in their story. Together, Sam and Rita fight a tense and emotional custody battle against the system. As the situation escalates, Lucy acts out, feeling torn between her love for her father and the realization that staying with him might not be the best for her future. Despite these obstacles, Lucy has poignant moments of childhood, like playing sports and forging new friendships, like with RANDY, who would become significant as her new foster parent. Through this journey, Sam's love for Lucy becomes his driving force, pushing him to exceed his own limitations to ensure her happiness.

In the climactic courtroom scenes, SAM's plight as a father comes to a head. LUCY, now caught between two worlds, must find her voice and make heart-wrenching decisions about her own destiny. Sam's unconventional family, including ANNIE who has her own fears of the outside world and sneaks helpful items on Sam's windowsill at night, offers solace and support. RITA, experiencing her transformation, defends Sam passionately, revealing her own vulnerabilities. The dual personal battles of Sam and Lucy culminate in a powerful testament to familial love and the resilience of the human spirit. As the legal battle unfolds, key witnesses like the photo booth employee, coworkers, and psychologist MS. GELLER, all contribute to the heart-stopping final verdict. Sam's relationship with Rita deepens through trials and revelations, ultimately leading to a future that respects Lucy's needs and Sam's undeniable love as a father. Lucy, blossoming into a teenager (16) and secretly visiting Sam, signifies the unbreakable bond between them, one that perseveres beyond the confines of traditional parenting and societal expectations.
