YOUNG ELIZABETH (10) hums a pirate tune aboard the HMS Dauntless as it cuts through the Caribbean Sea when the crew stumbles upon WILL TURNER (around 10), a young boy floating in the water. Ten years later, ELIZABETH SWANN (20) is grown up and being dressed for Commodore Norrington's promotion ceremony, struggling with her tight corset. The grown WILL TURNER (28) spots her from afar, his affection evident. During the ceremony, the notorious pirate JACK SPARROW arrives in Port Royal, bribes his way inside, and attempts to commandeer a ship. However, a series of events leads to Elizabeth's fall into the ocean, prompting Jack to rescue her. This heroic deed results in a faceoff with NORRINGTON (38) and his men and Jack's eventual capture after an exhilarating escape and sword fight with Will in the blacksmith's forge. That night, the infamous Black Pearl approaches Port Royal, blanketing the town with fear and darkness. The town is bombarded and ransacked by ARMED PIRATES led by Captain BARBOSSA, leading to the kidnapping of Elizabeth in exchange for a mysterious medallion she possesses.

In the second act, Elizabeth invokes her right to negotiate with Captain Barbossa and is taken aboard the Black Pearl, while Will witnesses the devastation and joins forces with Jack to pursue the ship and save Elizabeth. Barbossa, desiring freedom from a curse that has left him and his crew as undead skeletons in the moonlight, seeks the last piece of a treasured gold medallion. Meanwhile, Elizabeth discovers the crew's terrifyign curse firsthand. On the other end, Will releases Jack from jail and with the help of GIBBS (50), ANAMARIA, and other crew members, they commandeer the Dauntless. They sail it out to sea, managing narrow escapes and outmaneuvering Norrington to reach The Black Pearl. Will and Elizabeth join forces with Jack and take a side trip to the island of Tortuga, assembling a motley crew to pursue Barbossa and his henchmen to Isla de Muerta.

In the third act, the Interceptor, commandeered by Jack and his newly formed crew, chases the Black Pearl towards the secret Isla de Muerta. As Norrington's forces prepare to lay siege to the island, Will learns of his true connection to the cursed treasure and his father's fate. Jack and Will concoct a plan to use Will's blood to lift the curse, but treachery abounds. A massive fight ensues on both sea and shore â€” the undead pirates attack the Royal Navy aboard the Dauntless, and Barbossa attempts to eliminate Will to break the curse. As the two vessels clash, Elizabeth captains the Black Pearl to join the fray, turning the tide. In the caves, Jack and Barbossa engage in a final showdown, revealing a clever deception that leads to Barbossa's demise and the curse's end. The pirates surrender, and in the aftermath, Elizabeth chooses Will's love over her predestined life, sealing it with a passionate kiss. Meanwhile, Jack narrowly escapes his execution in Port Royal, returning to his beloved Black Pearl, setting sail for another adventure on the horizon.
