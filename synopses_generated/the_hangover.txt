James Bond (40s) crashes a wedding at the Bel Air Bay Club, disrupting the picturesque morning, while inside, Tracy Turner (20s) braces herself for the upcoming nuptials as she receives a distressing call about Doug. The Mojave Desert reveals the genesis of their troubles, where Vick Lennon (late 20s) confesses that they lost Doug during a raucous bachelor party. Their troubles intensify when, en route to Las Vegas in broad daylight, their Cadillac crashes on the Strip, creating chaos. In Las Vegas, the night's indulgence is evident as Vick (35) and his friends, including Stu and Alan, find themselves in the Dean Martin Suite after some shrewd persuasion by Vick. The high of their arrival plummets as Vick grows anxious over a call informing him of an unwanted visitor in Vegas, and Doug discovers a lavish diamond engagement ring, foreshadowing trouble.

As morning creeps in, the aftermath of their debauchery becomes clear; Alan (34) realizes Doug is missing, and Stu exhibits both physical and emotional distress. The friends embark on a frantic quest to retrace their steps, uncovering a series of bewildering clues: Doug's empty bedroom, a destroyed Cadillac, unexpected Elvis-themed wedding memorabilia, troubling stamps from various clubs, and an encounter with aggressive Samoans. Their misadventures tear through Las Vegas, leading them from neon-lit streets to the chaotic interior of Crazy Horse, culminating in an explosive confrontation with the Samoans that forces a retreat and results in rescue by the police. The quest climaxes at the Coyote Cantina, where amidst the scramble for elusive memories and Doug's whereabouts, revelations of a marriage, a stash of videotapes, and the group's undisclosed vulnerabilities come to the forefront. Their personal revelations are underscored by Stu's grappling with his sexuality and the precariousness of their predicament as they scramble to secure funds to negotiate with the menacing Jimmy Lang for Doug's release.

Revelation is the theme of the final act as the friends uncover Doug's location after interpreting his desperate rooftop signals. The rescue is punctuated by a high-speed escape in the battered Cadillac, racing against time back to Los Angeles. The setting shifts to an anxious bridal suite where Tracy (28) is rattled by the groom's ominous absence and the wedding guests' whispers. As Tracy's father attempts to soothe her fears, a climactic screech signals the groom's arrival. The ceremony occurs with relief and forgiveness, and the joyous reception is a testament to the journey's end. Vick stands in the men's bathroom, overwhelmed with gratitude as Jimmy Lang extends an olive branch through the repayment of debts by the unassuming hero, Alan. Vick, Stu, and Alan then join the luxurious reception, their toasts to Doug and Tracy marking the end of their tumultuous escapade and the start of a new, harmonious chapter.
