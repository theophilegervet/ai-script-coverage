The McauliffE Equation
by Andrew Bowen
Def Leppard’s “Pour Some Sugar On Me” begins to play O.S. A tiny LED pierces the blackness and begins “blinking” to the BEAT. A VOICE start SINGING along to the song.
DANIEL (O.S.)
(singing)
“Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon get it on.”
FADE IN:
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - COMPUTER BAY - NIGHT
Dozens of additional LEDs join the first - illuminating a large computer bay stacked, wall-to-wall, with huge RAID processing towers.
DANIEL (O.S.)
(singing the wrong words) “Livin' like a lover with a red iPhone.”
SUPER: VALENCIA, CALIFORNIA... TOMORROW NIGHT.
MAIN TITLES BEGIN
INT. DANIEL MCAULIFFE’S SECRET OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
TIGHT ON A COMPUTER - The edges of the monitor are covered in Post-It notes and Polaroid’s featuring everything from advanced equations to grocery shopping lists.
DANIEL (O.C.)
“Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp. Demolition woman, can I be your man?”
REVERSE - DANIEL MCAULIFFE (Mid-40’s, awkwardly handsome) sits in front of the computer, SINGING to the song playing LOUDLY from the BEATS by Dre covering his ears - and the bluetooth speaker in the corner.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
“Yeah, Yeah.”
He places his hand on a cool-looking scanner beside his keyboard. Nothing happens. Perplexed, he glances up - finding the Post-It above a GLOWING button on his hard drive that reads: DON’T FORGET TO ENGAGE THE QUANTUM INTERFACE.
Daniel presses a button, repeats the action and his computer ROARS TO LIFE!
DANIEL (CONT’D)
“Break it up. Pour some...”
Daniel excitedly gets up and follows a bundle of industrial cables out of his office and into --
INT. DANIEL’S SECRET PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS
-- a small passageway. Exposed insulation hangs from the ceiling. He DANCES towards a small staircase at the end, pulling a six-inch CAPTAIN AMERICA action figure from his pocket.
DANIEL
(to action figure) You ready to make history CAAAAAAHHH!!!!
He VANISHES from frame! WE ANGLE to the large note above the staircase that reads: “WATCH THE FIRST STEP!”
INT. DANIEL’S SECRET LAB - CONTINUOUS
Daniel TUMBLES out a doorway into a dark room, SLAMMING face first onto the floor.
DANIEL
(to himself) That hurt.
He painfully gets to his feet and FLICKS on the light swith.
WIDE - We are inside a secret laboratory. The room looks like an old bomb bunker. Unfinished “Projects” and GEEK paraphernalia are scattered about.
In the center of the room, dry ice PUMPS ACROSS the graphite top of two, cool-looking six foot towers: The QUANTUM DISPLACEMENT REACTOR.
Daniel places the action figure on the top of one of the towers the AIR-GUITARS a few feet to his work station: a large computer rests on a desk cluttered with pens, more post- its, and a small Keurig.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
(singing)
“Pour some sugar on me. Oh, in the name of love  ”
Daniel’s computer screen is displaying a layout of Southern California’s ENTIRE ENERGY GRID. He casually TYPES one-handed into his keyboard as he makes himself a coffee with the other.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
(typing)
Sorry So Cal, quantum experiment in progress. Need to borrow some juice.
Multiple WARNING windows POP UP across his screen. Daniel continues TYPING - overriding the security firewalls with remarkable ease.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Bla, bla, bla. I'm smarter than you and... scene.
He HITS the return key. The graphic on his monitor shows energy from ACROSS THE STATE converge on his location. The lights in the lab begin to GLOW with POWER. He glances at Captain America.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Time to change the world, Steve.
He DOUBLE CLICKS his mouse and A LASER begins to SCAN the action figure on the tower - digitally RE-BUILDING it on his screen.
Daniel leans back to sit in his chair and MISSES IT. FLAILING BACKWARD, he REACHES for his desk to catch his fall -- SPILLING his coffee across his computer - then KICKS the bottom of his desk, LAUNCHING a handful of PENS on it INTO THE AIR!
IN SLOW MOTION - We watch single DROP of coffee SAILS THROUGH THE AIR towards the action figure. AT THE EXACT moment it hits Cap’s head we see the PENS come down hitting a RANDOM SEQUENCE on Daniel’s keyboard. VRUUUUMMMM - Daniel’s computer SURGES with POWER as the equation on his screen begins RE- CONFIGURING itself! LIGHTS IN THE ROOM BURST! POWER CABLES BOUNCE WITH ENERGY!
TIGHT ON DANIEL - WIND begins SWIRLING around him like a tornado! He squints at something O.S.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
What in the...
A thundering BOOM LAUNCHES Daniel OFF HIS FEET and SLAMS him against the wall. A look of horror falls across his face as an INHUMAN ROAR rings out O.C.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
(terrified) Oh... My...
TITLE CARD FLASHES ACROSS SCREEN: THE MCAULIFFE EQUATION
PETER (O.S.)
(screaming)
JESSICA MARSHALL CHASE!
INT. JESSIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
JESSICA “JESSIE” CHASE (14, female, hispanic, awkward. A tomboy) BOLTS upright from her desk with a SCREAM, judo-chops the air then TUMBLES OUT OF FRAME with a THUD!
SUPER: VALENCIA, CALIFORNIA... TODAY.
Jessie’s bedroom is an explosion of geekiness: Sci-fi movie posters, video game insignias. An Infinity Gauntlet prop rests on her night stand.
PETER (O.S.)
You’re gonna be late for school again!
Jessie POPS back INTO FRAME, looks at the clock on her desk and pales. She WIPES the drool from her cheek, TEARS a FLASH DRIVE out of her computer and BOLTS out the door!
INT. JESSIE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
With the flash drive clenched between her teeth, Jessie hurriedly tries to apply some ancient looking eyeliner. We hear a KNOCK O.S.
CAMILLE (O.S.)
I need to use the bathroom!
JESSIE
(rushed) Hang on --
CAMILLE (17, pretty, total bitch) BARGES into the tiny bathroom and brushes past Jessie, watching YouTube on her cellphone.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(annoyed)
Camille, I’m almost done. Can you just give me a minute.
CAMILLE
(watching a video) Nope...
Camille PLOPS down on the toilet beside Jessie then looks up at her with a MALICIOUS GRIN.
CAMILLE (CONT’D)
But if you enjoy the fresh smell of shit in the morning, feel free to stay.
Camille CRINGES seeing Jessie’s face.
CAMILLE (CONT’D)
What’s on your face? Jessie shifts, uncomfortably.
CAMILLE (CONT'D)
(amused)
Is that supposed to be make-up?
Applying makeup is clearly something Jessie has zero skill at.
CAMILLE (CONT’D)
(with a sarcastic smile) Wow. You’re really good at that.
She punctuates her statement with a FART - signaling the beginning of her bowel movement. Jessie glares at her.
JESSIE
(sarcastic) Best sister, ever.
INT. JESSIE’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jessie lands at the bottom of the staircase and reaches for the front door.
PETER (O.S.)
You have to eat and take your vitamins before you leave!
Jessie turns to her father - PETER CHASE (40’s) - standing at the island in their kitchen (which is in the early stages of a re-model). A bowl of cereal and a cup of vitamins rest beside him.
JESSIE
Dad, Lucas and I are presenting the short film we made for our Environmental Science class today. It determines our final grade. I can’t be late.
Peter gives her a look; she isn’t going anywhere. Jessie EXHALES and crosses to the island. She dumps vitamins into her mouth, SWALLOWS them without water then reaches for her cereal. A black cat intercepts her hand.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(fuming) Not now, Jinks!
She PUSHES the cat out of the way and TOSSES a handful of cereal in her mouth.
PETER
I start my triple shift tonight at the pharmacy. Your sister is in charge till I get back Sunday.
JESSIE
(sarcastic)
Ah, an excellent decision.
She WASHES down the cereal with a GULP of Almond Milk.
PETER
I put forty bucks in the copper jar this time.
JESSIE
(chewing)
Dad, you don’t need to go over this every two weeks.
(wiping her mouth as she rises)
I promise l’ll re-stock the liquor cabinet after the party.
(she heads toward the door)
You’ve still got weed on your nightstand, right? I’m asking for Camille.
PETER
(sarcastic) You’re hilarious.
She smiles as she arrives at the door.
JESSIE
Love you, Dad.
PETER (O.C.)
Jess!
She EXHALES and SPINS to her Dad.
JESSIE
(incredulously) What Dad!?!
Peter points to Jessie’s legs.
PETER
You want to fix that first?
Jessie looks down.
POV - She’s still just wearing boxers.
JESSIE
(to herself) Crap.
INT. LUCAS MOKE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
LUCAS MOKE (Male, 14, overweight, Samoan) stands in-front of a mirror struggling to pin his long hair off his face. With a DOCTOR WHO tee-shirt and a DARK CRYSTAL backpack, he’s a walking version of Jessie’s bedroom.
Lucas’s Mom, ABIGAL “ABBY” MOKE (40. African American) WALKS into the kitchen. She stops the moment she sees him.
LUCAS
(defensively) What?
ABIGAIL
I... I’m just not used to actually seeing your face.
LUCAS
Long hair is in, Mom.
ABIGAIL
I know. I think you look dope. (correcting herself)
I mean totes... (reaching)
Lit?
LUCAS
(cringing)
Mom, don’t use ANY of those words in a sentence. Like, ever.
ABIGAIL
(dying to help Lucas with his hair)
You know, the one benefit of having an actor for a Mom is that I’m really good with hair.
Lucas stares at her for a moment, then EXHALES with a nod. Abby excitedly takes over.
ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
(re: Lucas’s hair)
Do you ever wonder if there’s a Whooville in here?
(Lucas SMIRKS)
You’re in a positive mood today. What’s the big occasion?
LUCAS
(excited)
I... Jessie and I are showing our short film for Environmental Science today.
(hopeful)
I think it might just be a social game changer for us.
ABIGAIL
What short film?
LUCAS
(incredulous)
You made the costumes for it.
ABIGAIL
Oh, that short film! (LAUGHS)
Man, that thing is so funny!
Lucas turns at her, horrified.
LUCAS
Funny?
ABIGAIL
Yeah...
(confused) It’s a comedy...
(reaching) Right?
The color drains from Lucas’s face.
EXT. VALENCIA HIGH SCHOOL - SANTA CLARITA - MOMENTS LATER
Lucas nervously paces outside the main doors of the High School, nursing a Coke-Zero. Students file past him, barely acknowledging his existence. His unfinished, partially pinned hairdo looks ridiculous.
LUCAS
(quietly to himself)
Don’t show up. Don’t show up. Don’t show up...
LUCAS!
JESSIE (O.C.)
Lucas mouths a colorful metaphor as Jessie arrives beside him
-- It’s looks like she vigorously wiped the makeup off her face with a piece of sandpaper.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(bursting with excited energy)
Sorry, I’m late.
LUCAS
Was hoping you got lost or...
He notices Jessie’s MAKEUP FAIL.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(horrified) What’s on your face?
JESSIE
(sardonic)
Oh, you mean my attempt to apply makeup?
LUCAS
Yeah...
(a beat) It looks bad.
JESSIE
(matter-of-fact) I know.
(re: Lucas’s hair)
I see I wasn’t the only one who attempt to “spruce themselves up” a bit today.
Lucas nods touching his quasi-pompadour. Jessie attempts to fix it.
LUCAS
Better?
JESSIE
Not at all.
They SMILE: They’re hopeless - but at least they’re hopeless together.
LUCAS
I was kinda hoping you’d call in sick.
Jessie LIFTS up her flash drive.
JESSIE
(bursting with pride)
And miss the day our cinematic efforts catapult us into social significance?
A half eaten Twinky suddenly SPLATS AGAINST HER CHEEK.
STUDENTS (O.S.)
FUGLY!
LUCAS
Or maybe... Since we’ve been living in the shadows of social purgatory for so long we thought, “Hey, why not do something that helps us reach an even deeper level of suck.”
Jessie puts a confident hand on Lucas’s shoulder.
JESSIE
Lucas, this is the moment we’ve been working towards our whole lives!
(The Twinky jiggles from her cheek like a growth)
The day we emerge from the shadows
of insignificance and into the warm embrace of popularity.
(unwavering confidence)
We’re game-changing the crap out of our lives today!
Lucas smiles. Jessie’s optimism is infectious. He PEELS the Twinky off her cheek and casually POPS it into his mouth.
STUDENTS (O.S.)
OMG! So gross! Ratchet!
A look of surprise falls across his face as he CHEWS.
LUCAS
(re: the Twinky) It’s fresh today.
JESSIE
(shocked) What?
Jessie LICKS the excess filling off Lucas’s finger: her face lights up.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
If this isn’t a positive sign, I don’t know what is?
They share a mutual smile.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(unwavering confidence) Let’s go change our destiny, my friend!
The dramatic SWELL of a MOVIE SCORE begins to PLAY O.S.
CUT TO:
EXT. LA RIVER - “LUCAS AND JESSIE’S STUDENT FILM/VIDEO” - DAY
TIGHT - Lucas turns to camera, dirt spattered across his face. Wind and smoke are swirling around him. A lens flare FLASHES the screen. Are we in a J.J. Abrams movie?
LUCAS
(dramatic bad acting)
GET OUT OF THERE! THE DETONATOR’S ABOUT TO BLOW!
LAUGHTER breaks out O.S. Jessie (also dirty) scrambles to get out of a concrete water pipe as a monster (guy in a bad monster costume) reaches for her.
JESSIE
(over-dramatic) SAVE YOURSELF!!!
More LAUGHTER erupts O.S. We PULL BACK from the action -- INT. VALENCIA HIGH SCHOOL, AUDITORIUM - DAY
-- into a packed High School Auditorium watching Lucas and Jessie’s “student film” projected on-stage. The are students HOWLING with laughter. Lucas and Jessie are nowhere to be seen.
MADISON WU (30’s, Asian, WAY too beautiful to be a teacher) glares disapprovingly at the students when the BELL RINGS.
MADISON
(YELLING as they quickly file out)
IF YOU PLAN TO JOIN THE FIELD TRIP TO WESTFORD LABORATORIES MONDAY MORNING, I NEED PERMISSION SLIPS ON MY DESK BY...
The auditorium is already empty. Madison EXHALES: why do I even try? She solemnly makes her way up the main aisle to a row of seats near the back and turns to them.
MADISON (CONT’D)
They’re all gone. You can get up now.
POV - Jessie and Lucas are laying on the floor hiding under a row of seats, staring at the ceiling mortified.
LUCAS
We’re good.
JESSIE
Pretty sure we’ll be comfortable here for the rest of our lives.
MADISON
(re: students) They’re just jealous.
JESSIE
(sarcastic)
Oh yeah, of course. I mean who in this school doesn’t wish they were us right now.
MADISON
(trying to “spin” it)
I thought it was awesome. You’re both getting A’s. I...
JESSIE
It’s OK Miss Wu, you don’t need to try and cheer us up.
MADISON
I’m not. I really thought it was ingenious.
(genuine)
All the pop culture references in there. Loved the nod to Neo!
Lucas perks up.
LUCAS
You got that?
MADISON
(nodding) Of course.
He smiles at her, admiring her hair.
LUCAS
Did you get a haircut?
MADISON
(someone noticed) I did.
LUCAS
It looks really nice.
Jessie GLARES at Lucas: OMFG.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(defensive)
What? It accentuates her cheekbones.
Jessie DRY HEAVES then YANKS Lucas to his feet.
JESSIE
OK, we’re gonna go now.
She starts DRAGGING HIM to the exit.
LUCAS
What are you...
JESSIE
(to Madison)
Thank you for not giving away our location during that soul crushing experience, Miss Wu. You are a saint.
(a beat)
If you could do us a solid and destroy the flash drive that video exists on, we’d appreciate it.
(sincere)
Knowing only the kids in this class saw it, will help us avoid becoming another teen statistic --
INT. VALENCIA HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
-- CLANG! The auditorium doors closes behind them.
JESSIE
(to Lucas, disgusted)
I swear to god, I’m gonna throw up on you.
What?
LUCAS
JESSIE
(stating the obvious)
The repulsive crush you have on our Environmental Science teacher!
LUCAS
(blushing) She’s so goals.
JESSIE
No, no, no!
(a beat)
Margot Robbie is goals. Scarlett Johansson is goals.
(pointed)
Miss Wu is NOT goals, my friend.
CAMERON (O.C.)
Dude, she’s so goals.
Jessie turns with a cringe to CAMERON PIKE (15, Male, Gay, Geeky) and PARKER BLUE (14, female, goth) who've arrived beside them. Parker is recoding a Snapchat video.
PARKER
(into camera) Goals.
Jessie BATS her phone away, annoyed.
JESSIE
What do you want ladies?
CAMERON
Freddy’s home sick today and just wanted me to tell you that he uploaded your film to YouTube this morning, like you asked.
All the color DRAINS from Jessie and Lucas’s face.
LUCAS
(to Jessie, mortified) You didn’t?
CAMILLE walks by with a group of seniors, watching the VIDEO her cellphone, ROARING WITH LAUGHTER. She smiles at Jessie as she passes.
CAMILLE
(maleficent delight) Best sister, ever!
EXT. PARK TRAIL, WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
Jessie and Lucas RACE along a trail leading away from school. They’re both on their CELL PHONES in a STATE OF PANIC.
LUCAS
I can’t believe you did this!
JESSIE
(apologetic)
I thought our film was going to have a much different reception.
LUCAS
Why? Because the rest of our lives have been such a dream thus far!?
JESSIE
He’s not answering my texts.
LUCAS (CONT'D) TRY HIS LAND LINE!
Jessie DIALS and puts the phone to her ear.
JESSIE
(impatiently) Pick up, pick up...
FREDDY (O.S.)
This is B-Dog.
JESSIE
(furious)
Freddy!?! Why aren’t you answering our texts?
INT. FREDDY BERNS GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
FREDDY BURNS (16. Jewish. Genius. Extra AF) answers the phone, POUNDING AWAY on the keyboard of his computer.
FREDDY
You know they created “do not disturb” for a reason, Jessie.
Freddy’s room looks like a mix between a rat’s nest, a comic book shop, and the offices of Google.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
Can’t talk. I’m in the middle of a very intense OVERWATCH campaign with some scientists at Cern but I posted the short you made with Lucas on YouTube, per your request, and gave it a big social media birth so.... You’re welcome.
EXT. PARK TRAIL - CONTINUOUS
CLICK - the line goes dead.
JESSIE
(furious) Freddy? FREDDY?
LUCAS
Did he just hang up on you?
Jessie nods, remorsefully. Lucas DROPS his head.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Well, this day can’t get any worse?
DEXTER (O.C.)
If it isn’t puke face and twiddle dick.
LUCAS
Nope. I stand corrected.
Lucas turns to the smiling mug of DEXTER WALLER (18, douchebag) as his fist FLIES INTO HIS FACE!
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MOMENTS LATER
Lucas and Jessie sit on rusted outdoor exercise equipment at the edge of the large park. Jessie is SHOVING TISSUE up her bloody nostril.
LUCAS
(pissed)
Who hits girls in 2020!?
JESSIE
(self-deprecating)
Pretty sure he doesn’t know I am one.
It is kinda hard to tell that Jessie is a girl.
LUCAS
(apologetic)
If puberty hadn’t decided to be on some kind of rare, freakish delay for the both of us, I might have been able to defend us.
JESSIE
It’s OK.
(self-deprecating)
Thanks to my baby fat and the defensive shield of sarcastic wit I’ve developed, I don’t feel much.
Lucas shakes his head.
LUCAS
(overwhelmed) We’re cursed.
JESSIE
Without question. (positive)
But hey, it’s not like anybody is gonna be going out of their way to find a video we made. The one advantage of being “bottom dwellers” is nobody knows we exist.
LUCAS
Except your evil, super popular sister.
Jessie stares at her cellphone uncomfortably.
JESSIE
(flat)
Well... that was quick.
LUCAS
(worried) What?
She reluctantly shows Lucas her phone.
INSERT PHONE - Jessie’s Instagram feed features post-after- post of a meme of Lucas screaming “GET OUT OF THERE” from their short.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(re: the student body) They’re gonna be relentless.
JESSIE
On an epic scale.
LUCAS
(frustrated)
Why does everything always have to go wrong for us?
Lucas STANDS and start to march away in a huff.
JESSIE
Come on Lucas, this isn’t that bad.
Jessie grabs Lucas’s backpack and tries to catch up.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
We don’t wan’t to be like all the popular kids at our school, desperate for “likes” to feel validated anyway!
LUCAS
Popular? I’d just like to have a glimmer of hope. Be invited to a party on occasion! Have friends!?
JESSIE
We have friends.
LUCAS
Who... The Goonies? (exasperated)
Cam and Parker are people you crowd around a fire with for warmth.
Jessie NODS to herself: there is some truth to that.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
That video was supposed to change things for us Jessie. Make us cool.
JESSIE
We are cool.
Lucas stops.
LUCAS
Really? How many people follow you on Instagram?
(a beat)
Other than your Dad?
Jessie doesn’t respond. Lucas continues to MARCH towards some MONKEY BARS.
JESSIE
(the optimist)
So our film didn’t go over as well as we hoped... and may haunt us for years to come.. But our lives aren’t that bleak.
LUCAS
Jessie we’re two socially awkward, non-athletic “ethnic” teens living in California’s last white hope!
(a beat)
It doesn’t get much bleaker than that.
(after a long beat - emotional)
I’m so tired of being a nobody.
JESSIE
You’re not a nobody. You’re like the coolest person I know!
LUCAS
I’m the ONLY person you know.
JESSIE
So?
LUCAS
(emotional/stinging) Well, excuse me for wanting a little more!
Jessie looks away: that one hurt.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(feeling horrible) Jessie, I’m...
Unable to find the words, Lucas turns and runs toward some old MONKEY BARS.
LUCAS (CONT’D) (SCREAMING)
WHY CAN’T SOMETHING COOL HAPPEN TO US! JUST FOR ONCE!
As he runs underneath them he’s ENGULFED in a SWIRLING VORTEX OF BLINDING LIGHT - and with A CRACKLING BOOM - vanishes into thin air!
Jessie blinks and looks around: WTF? LUCAS IS GONE. She nervously calls out.
JESSIE
L... Lucas?
With a SONIC BOOM, the BLINDING LIGHT RE-APPEARS and a
futuristic-soldier (40’s, a hulk of a man: The Rock) comes sailing out of it, BACKWARDS - FIRING his PULSE RIFLE back INTO IT as LASERS WHIZ past his head!
The soldier SLAMS ON THE GROUND as the VORTEX COLLAPSES and SLIDES several feet - before coming to a stop inches from Jessie’s feet.
TIGHT ON JESSIE - She looks down at the soldier with awestruck confusion - steam rising off his a tattered cloak.
She JUMPS BACK as the soldier HOPS up and WHIPS OPEN his cloak - revealing THE FUTURISTIC IRON MAN-LIKE TACTICAL ARMOR
HE’S WEARING UNDERNEATH. Jessie’s jaw DROPS OPEN in awe. The soldier “check himself for holes” - then EXHALES, relieved.
SOLDIER
(out of breath) Thank God.
(into his earpiece)
Is anyone from Alpha team still alive?
(intense)
SILK? RIPCORD? ARE YOU...
His voice trails off as he takes in his surroundings for the first time.
SOLDIER (CONT’D)
What the hell? I... (confused)
It can’t be?... Impossible.
He senses Jessie behind him and SPINS, leveling his rifle on her. Jessie THROWS HER HANDS UP with a frightened YELP.
JESSIE
(terrified)
Don’t shoot, Don’t shoot!
SOLDIER
Are you a friendly?
JESSIE
A what?
SOLDIER
A friendly?
(a secret code) Black Dragon.
(LUNGING at her aggressively)
BLACK DRAGON!
The soldier suddenly stops. After a beat, he LOWERS HIS RIFLE and stares at Jessie, dumbfounded.
SOLDIER (CONT’D)
J... Jessie?
Jessie TILTS her head; how did he know my name?
SOLDIER (CONT’D)
(emotional)
Am... Am I really back?... Is that really you?
The soldier SHAKES his head, getting his bearings back and GLARES at her.
SOLDIER (CONT’D)
(angrily)
Oh, I get it... This is some sort of new Klathorian trick isn’t it? You tapped into my memories or something...
(pissed)
What is this, a new kind of holo- projection? A temporal input? Grim worms?
Jessie is too freaked out and confused to respond. The soldier AIMS his rifle at her again!
SOLDIER (CONT’D) WHAT IS THIS PLACE!?
Jessie GULPS and forces her lips to move.
JESSIE
Va... Va... Valencia.
The soldier BLINKS.
SOLDIER
Oh my god... It’s really you?
He POKES Jessie in the chest with the tip of his gun.
JESSIE
Ouch.
SOLDIER
It’s over... It’s finally over...
The soldier lets out A EUPHORIC YELP and lifts Jessie into a HUG. Jessie SCREAMS and starts judo-chopping his head!
SOLDIER (CONT’D) WHOA! RELAX, RELAX.
He puts Jessie down. She JUMPS BACK on defensively, LIFTING her hands karate style.
JESSIE
(re: her hands)
These hands are registered weapons.
SOLDIER
It’s OK.
(soft/calm)
I’m not gonna hurt you.
Jessie stares, trying to determine if he’s lying.
SOLDIER (CONT’D)
(calm)
Jessie, it’s me.... It’s Lucas.
Jessie BLINKS. What did he just say?
LUCAS
Your best friend, Lucas Moke.
Jessie stares at the soldier, trying to process what he just said. After a beat, she starts to manically LAUGH.
JESSIE
OK! Look Sir, I don’t know what’s going on right now? My best friend just vanished in a flash of light and I think I’m a having a conversation with the ethnic version of Deadpool’s Cable.
(rationalizing)
Clearly, I’m having some kind of massive mental collapse.
(a beat)
I’m also pretty sure I shit my pants a little when you pointed your wicked cool and very REAL looking rifle at me, so...
(taking a breath)
If you don’t mind, I’d like to go home right now, clean myself up and hopefully find a safe corner to cry in.
The soldier fights back the urge to LAUGH.
LUCAS
You’re not having a mental collapse right now, Jessie. It is possible you did just crap in your pants a little bit, but...
(calm)
It’s really me. It’s Lucas.
A beat passes between them.
JESSIE
Bullshit.
LUCAS
Your full name is Jessica Marshal Chase. You where Born on March 31st, 2006. You want to be a director when you grow up, have watched James Cameron’s ALIENS about a thousand times and fart when you’re nervous.
Jessie FARTS.
JESSIE
(suspiciously)
All facts... Any creepy, social media trolling, albeit highly skilled cos-player could easily get off the internet.
LUCAS
Your most prized possession is an original printing of Incredible Hulk #181 that features the introduction of Wolverine.
(a beat)
A comic book that would be worth a fortune today if you hadn’t written “Jessie” in the top left corner of it when you where six.
Jessie’s JAW ALMOST HITS THE GROUND.
JESSIE
Holy... Lucas?
He nods.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
What the hell is going on?
LUCAS
I have no idea?
(trying to piece it together)
I was -- OWW!
Lucas SLAPS his neck like he was BITTEN by a mosquito. He flicks whatever bit him onto the ground and continues:
LUCAS (CONT’D)
I was trying to make it to the safety of this tree line. Two Klathorian Units and more Lugorcs than I’d ever seen were on-top of me... It was like their whole army was after me...
JESSIE
Wait? Kalath-a-what? (incredulously)
No!?! I mean, a minutes ago you looked like me, and now you look like STAR-LORD!?
KID 1 (O.S.)
WHOA SICK!?!?
KID 2 (O.S.) WICKED COSTUME DUDE!!!
Like a reflex, Lucas SPINS - RAISING HIS RIFLE on two eleven year olds who've arrived on bikes a few feet away - and FIRES TWICE! Two projectiles SLAM INTO THE KIDS CHESTS, sending them FLYING ONTO THEIR BACKS! Jessie pales.
JESSIE
OH MY GOD!
LUCAS
(cringing) Sorry.
JESSIE
(freaking out) SORRY!?!
She RACES over to the kids as they SPASAM on the ground for a few seconds - then stop moving.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(incredulously)
Did you just kill two kids!
LUCAS
No. Thoser were non-lethal rounds. (reassuringly)
Relax, they’ll just be paralyzed for a couple of hours.
JESSIE
(sarcastically) Oh, what a relief!?
LUCAS
(defensive)
Hey, I just somehow traveled back in time after witnessing humanity fall to the Klathorians in a war I’ve been fighting in for 20 years!
(matter-of-fact)
You’d be a little on edge too!
JESSIE
You... Traveled into the future?
Lucas PUTS A HAND on Jessie’s shoulder.
LUCAS
Jess, I don’t think it’s a good idea for me to be out in public right now.
JESSIE
Agreed.
LUCAS
So, what do you say we go back to your house and try to figure out what the hell just happened to me?
Jessie NODS.
JESSIE
Sounds like a plan.
(re: the unconscious kids) (MORE)
JESSIE (CONT'D)
If you could try not to paralyze any other children before we get there, that would be great.
LUCAS
Noted.
As they leave the park, we PAN DOWN to the spot where Lucas had flicked the BUG THAT BIT HIM. A maggot-sized blob PULSATES IN THE GLASS.
TIGHT ON BLOB - A mouth appears at the top of it, GARGLING a DROP OF BLOOD in it’s SHARK-LIKE TEETH. It SWALLOWS THE
BLOOD, lets out a menacing “SQUEEK” and LIKE A HUMAN CELL, begins to SPLIT APART like it’s DUPLICATING ITSELF.
INT. JESSIE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Lucas is sitting on Jessie’s bed trying to relax as Jessie PACES - barely contain her excitement.
JESSIE
(clarifying)
So, let me get this straight. That vortex of light you stepped into was some kind of “temporal vortex” that sent you 14 years into the future - where you spent 20 years fighting in a war against the Kardashians?
LUCAS
Klathorians.
JESSIE
Right. Humanoids from another dimension, who conquered, then wiped out the human race.
(off Lucas’s nod)
That arrived here because of that.
She POINTS to a small device on her desk that is PROJECTING A HOLOGRAM of an advanced-looking mathematical equation. An octagon of complex symbols and numbers.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
The MacGyver Malaysian.
LUCAS
(correcting her) Mcauliffe Equation.
JESSIE
Right... An experiment this Mcauliffe guy did, that opened a dimensional wormhole on earth that allowed those Klathorian’s to enter our dimension.
(Lucas nods) This is unbelievable.
Jessie’s cat JUMPS ON THE BED beside Lucas. He spins, RAISING his rifle at the cat. Jessie LEAPS IN FRONT OF LUCAS and PUSHES the barrel of his rifle away.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
WHAO! It’s just my cat, Lucas!
Lucas takes a DEEP BREATH.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(worried)
Wow... You need to chill. You want me to see if my Dad’s got some Xanax laying around?
LUCAS
(lying) No. I’m fine.
Jessie doesn’t push it.
JESSIE
OK. So, how did you arrive back here?
LUCAS
(frustrated)
I told you, I don’t know? I don’t even know what created that vortex that sent me into the future to begin with!
Several sections of Lucas’s armor BEGIN TO GLOW.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(confused) What the hell?
Jessie geeks out as Lucas POPS OPEN a panel on his gauntlet and a HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACE appears.
JESSIE
(under her breath) So rad.
LUCAS
Impossible.
Lucas begins furiously TYPING into his interface.
JESSIE
What’s going on?
LUCAS
I think someone’s hacking my communications matrix...
BAMF!!! A fractured HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE APPEARS over Lucas’s gauntlet and BEGINS TO PLAY.
INSERT HOLOGRAPHIC VIDEO - An old man, FLYING SOME KIND OF
FUTURISTIC SHIP, addresses camera. It’s an 80 year old DANIEL MCAULIFFE!
OLD MCAULIFFE
Lucas, if you’ve been here as long as I think you ----, you know who I am. I’m sorry I didn’t have time to tell you --- in person, but the Klathorians got wind -- my plan before --- ---.
(SCREAMS OFF CAMERA) FIRE UP --- SEQUENCER!!!
(continuing)
Sorry about what happened to you. I had no idea the wormhole’s blast wave could travel   time-space
itself.
(SCREAMS OFF CAMERA) ISOLATE --- QUANTUM STREAMS!!!
(continuing)
If my ------ worked and you’re seeing this, you should be back in -
-------, about -- hours before I do my experiment!
(SCREAMS OFF CAMERA) ENGAGE THE    DRIVE!!!
(desperate)
I know I’m responsible for all this. I’m sorry. But this -- our only chance to fix it.
(a beat)
Find me Lucas! Stop me   doing
the equation and re-write --- future! Close ---- ------   and
save --- human race!
FANZZAP!!! The hologram splinters out. Jessie stares at Lucas.
JESSIE
What the hell was that?
LUCAS
(trying to process it)
I think that was Daniel Mcauliffe.
JESSIE
The guy responsible for all this?
Lucas nods.
LUCAS
(intense)
The date. What’s the exact date today?
Uh...
JESSIE
(checking her phone) The 20th. June, 20th, 2020.
LUCAS
I don’t believe it... Mcauliffe sent me back here to stop it from happening.
JESSIE
Stop what from happening?
LUCAS
The Mcauliffe Equation. (a beat)
Jessie, the experiment Daniel did took place at 12:12AM, June 21st, 2020.
JESSIE
That’s tomorrow.
LUCAS
Exactly. It hasn’t happened yet! Jessie can barely contain her excitement.
JESSIE
Oh my god... DID OUR LIVES JUST BECOME A TERMINATOR MOVIE!?
Lucas CHUCKLES to himself a bit.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
And you said nothing cool ever happened to us.
(pumped)
Let’s go find this Mcauliffe son of a bitch and save the day!
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - VALENCIA, CA - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel rounds the hallway of an upscale technology lab, fumbling with a laptop. He’s trailing his annoyed-looking boss, HENRY SPARKS (early 30’s).
DANIEL
(frustrated)
But Henry, every simulation I’ve run has worked. Look at the data!
He SHOVES his laptop into Henry’s hands.
HENRY
Daniel, the processing speed you’d need to map every atom of a human body...
DANIEL
I’m not teleporting a human. I’m teleporting Captain America.
(off Henry’s confused look)
An action figure of him.
He accidentally TRIPS over a decorative plant in the hall and HITS the floor FACE FIRST!
HENRY
Are you OK?
Daniel pops back up, shaking it off.
DANIEL
‘Meant to do that.
Blood begins to trickle from his nose.
HENRY
(recoiling)
Jesus, you’re bleeding Daniel.
Daniel pinches his nose.
DANIEL
Look, the raid towers in the computer bay have more than enough power to launch my processing matrix. The quantum algorithm I created will do the rest. I just need a spark.
HENRY
(insinuating lunacy)
Which will require us to syphon Southern California’s entire power grid!
DANIEL
(shrugs)
For like 15 seconds.
HENRY
Which is all it would take to send us to jail for the rest of our lives.
DANIEL
If they found out? (under his breath)
It’s very easy to mask your digital footprint.
Henry hands Daniel back his laptop as he reaches his office.
He PLACES HIS HAND ON THE SECURITY SCANNER on his door - and
it slides open.
HENRY
Your “Beam me up Scotty” is a fascinating concept Daniel. But I’m not going to jail for it.
He SLAMS the door in Daniel’s face.
DANIEL
Dumb.
(a beat)
I didn’t want to resort to this Henry but...
Daniel FLIPS his laptop over. A GRAPHITE STICKER is mounted to the underside of it that has COPIED HENRY’S HANDPRINT.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
I can’t let visionless corporate zombies stand in the way of the greatest advancement in human history.
LUCAS (O.S.)
The cell tower’s this way?
EXT. PARK TRAIL, WOODS - LATER
JESSIE
Yeah, top of the hill.
Lucas and Jessie are HIGH-TAILING it along the same trail from earlier. Jessie can’t stop staring at the advanced- looking holographic computer interface Lucas is TYPING into on his gauntlet.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
So sick.
(re: his armor’s computer)
You can really hack into satellites with your armor?
LUCAS
(nodding)
Once I’m linked up, I should be able to pinpoint Mcauliffe’s location in nano-seconds.
(in agreement)
This armor operating system is Klathorian technology. Wicked fast.
JESSIE
Klathorian technology? I thought they were the bad guys?
LUCAS
Well, humans didn’t know that at first.
(explaining)
Only a handful of Klathorians arrived here when the Mcauliffe Equation happened.All the data was destroyed when the wormhole collapsed, so The Klathorians needed Mcauliffe to re-open that dimensional gateway.
(a beat)
So, under this “banner of peace”, they shared their technology to build a bridge to “connect our cultures” and people just ate it up.
(angry)
Our defenses were completely down when they launched their attack. By the time people realized the wormhole was a “bridge to conquer” it was too late.
(angry)
They played us perfectly.
They come upon Dexter, vaping by a tree.
JESSIE
(sarcastic) Great.
Lucas STOPS and stares at Dexter for a long moment.
LUCAS
(remembering)
Didn’t he kick our asses earlier today?
He raises his eyebrow and marches towards him.
JESSIE
Lucas, what are you doing?
LUCAS
(over his shoulder)
I think you might enjoy this.
Lucas arrives in front of Dexter - who takes in his “outfit” and CHUCKLES to himself.
DEXTER
You get lost finding a Star Wars convention, bra?
Lucas smiles and taps a BUTTON on his GAUNTLET. It OPENS, revealing a COMPARTMENT - HOLDING A SMALL SILVER BALL. He
pulls the ball out and TOSSES it to Dexter.
LUCAS
Catch!
Dexter moronically does.
DEXTER
(looking at the ball) What’s this?
LUCAS
Karma.
Lucas presses a BUTTON on his wrist and the silver ball EXPANDS, ENVELOPING Dexter inside a GLOWING PLASMA BUBBLE.
Dexter’s face is frozen in a terrified scream as bands of ELECTRICAL ENERGY pass over his face and body.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Dexter, you’re trapped inside a Thorium Plasma Sphere. It’s impossible to escape, so don’t even try. Blink once if you understand me.
(Dexter BLINKS)
Excellent. While you can’t move, you’ll be fully aware of the horror that’s happening to you while you’re inside it.
(reassuring)
Don’t worry, the sphere will dissolve on its own in about 19 hours. While you’ll leave physically unharmed, the psychological damage will haunt you for decades to come.
(a beat)
I hope you have a good bladder, because whatever comes out of you will stay with you for the duration.
(smiles)
(MORE)
LUCAS (CONT’D)
I suggest you use this time to reevaluate your choices in life. Like the one that makes you think is OK to hit girls.
He KICKS the SPHERE! Jessie watches in euphoric awe as the sphere FLIES UP into the trees and begin SILENTLY bouncing BACK-AND-FOURTH between the tree-tops like he’s inside A GIANT PIN-BALL MACHINE.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
God, that felt good.
Lucas turns to Jessie who THRUSTS a finger up to SILENCE him.
JESSIE
Just gonna need a second, here.
She SHUTS HER EYES to compose herself - then looks at Lucas with a smile.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Welcome home.
Lucas smiles. It fades as he’s overcome by a painful memory.
LUCAS
Home.
(emotional)
She’s still alive, isn’t she?
JESSIE
Who, your mom?
(Lucas nods)
I frickin’ hope so.
Lucas struggles to contain his emotions.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(softening) Hey.. Are you OK?
He NODS.
LUCAS
Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. (shaking it off)
Come on, let’s get to that cell tower.
EXT. HILLSIDE - CELL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER
Jessie is beside Lucas, still GEEKING OUT, as he wires his gauntlet into a panel at the base of the large cell tower.
JESSIE
You close?
Jessie PULLS OUT her cell phone and frames Lucas up behind her.
LUCAS
Should be wired up in a few more seconds.
JESSIE’S CELLPHONE POV - She’s started to RECORD an INSTAGRAM
story.
JESSIE
Well folks, today is your lucky day. It’s not often you get to watch someone save the world. But fortunately for you....
LUCAS
What the hell are you doing?
JESSIE
(matter-of-fact)
Posting to my Instagram story?
Lucas, GLARES AT HER like she’s insane.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Don’t worry, I’m tagging you.
LUCAS STOP RECORDING.
LUCAS STOP RECORDING NOW.
She lowers her phone.
LUCAS
JESSIE (CONT'D)
I...
JESSIE (CONT'D)
OK, geez.
Delete it.
JESSIE
You do know our faces are never gonna make us famous?
LUCAS
(firm)
Delete it now, Jessie.
Jessie reluctantly TAPS her phone and SLIDES IT back into her pocket. Lucas stares at her incredulously.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
I really have no words right now.
Jessie PLOPS down beside him, guilty.
Sorry.
JESSIE
Lucas continues to work.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
So, what else can your armor do?
LUCAS
(a warning)
Paralyze stupid teenagers.
JESSIE
(defensive/apologetic) I said, sorry.
Jessie, pouts for a moment watching Lucas work. Unable not to geek out over his armor, she innocently REACHES for a RED BUTTON located near his chest.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
What does this button do--
AHHHH!!!!
LUCAS
He BATS Jessie’s hand AWAY, horrified!
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Are you insane?
JESSIE
(innocently) What?
LUCAS
You almost killed us!
He EXHALES like he just “dodged a bullet” and makes sure the protective plate covering the RED BUTTON is secure.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(adult seriousness)
Look, Jessie. I think I might need to take you back home.
JESSIE
WHAT!?!
LUCAS
I’m not sure you’re mature enough for all this.
JESSIE
YES I AM!
LUCAS
This isn’t a game. The future of the human race is at stake here.
JESSIE I KNOW THAT LUCAS!
Jessie calms down, taking responsibility for her actions.
JESSIE (CONT'D)
I’m sorry. You’re right, I’ve been letting my excitement cloud my judgment too much... but please.
(pleading)
I swear to God, I’ll be cool from now on.
Lucas gives her a “less than” confident look.
LUCAS
Don’t touch ANY buttons on my armor.
JESSIE
(confirming) No buttons.
LUCAS
(firm) Like EVER.
JESSIE
Got it. It won’t happen again.
Lucas’s ARMOR suddenly lets out a horrible WHINING SOUND.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(defensive)
I didn’t touch anything!
LUCAS
(re: his armor) No, no, no....
Lucas POPS open a CIRCUITRY PANEL on his gauntlet - when his armor POWERS DOWN.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Son of a bitch! (Pissed)
My power cell is drained.
INSERT: A CLOCK on Lucas’s gauntlet begins to COUNT DOWN from 11:00.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
It’ll be 11 hours until the system re-boots. All I have access to are my primary weapons.
(triggered)
Well... There goes finding Mcauliffe quickly.
He SLAMS his fist against the tower, ANGRILY!
JESSIE
Whoa! It’s all good. (calming mode)
We got this. We’ll just use another computer to Google Mcauliffe.
LUCAS
(pointedly)
One that’s fast and has a lot of power.
JESSIE
Well, nothing is gonna be as fast as your super-suit, but...
LUCAS
(remembering something) Freddy. He’s got the fastest computer we know.
(getting up) Come on.
JESSIE
(horrified)
What!? No, no, no. There is no way we are bringing Freddy into this!
LUCAS
Jessie...
JESSIE
(VIGOROUSLY SHAKING HER HEAD)
No. Not gonna happen. End of discussion. Moving on.
LUCAS
I need you to act like an adult here.
JESSIE
WHICH IS EVEN MORE OF A REASON NOT TO INCLUDE FREDDY!?
Jessie does have a point there.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(very rational)
Look, your computer will be fast enough.
LUCAS
I just told you my armor’s operating system won’t re-boot for eleven hour---
JESSIE
Not your super computer asshat! Your Mac Book pro.
(Lucas is confused)
The one your Mom gave you for your birthday?
Lucas nods, remembering a memory from long ago.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
You left it home today. We’ll just swing by your house and pick it up.
LUCAS
(unconvinced)
Freddy’s computer is still gonna be faster.
JESSIE
Uh, it’s not like Freddy lives in Korea. We all have the same internet speed. We’re talking the difference of maybe ten minutes here.
(pleading)
Lucas, I’m begging you. Please let us make Freddy a last resort.
Lucas RELUCTANTLY NODS.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(relieved) Thank you.
Lucas SLINGS his rifle over his shoulder.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
You know, I think seeing your Mom is gonna be a really good thing for you.
Lucas LAUGHS at it the absurdity of Jessie’s statement.
LUCAS
I’m not going with you.
JESSIE
Yes, you are.
LUCAS
No, I’m not.
JESSIE
Lucas, I’ve actually been thinking about this a lot since you got back. You’re dealing with some serious trauma.
(MORE)
JESSIE (CONT'D)
(He shoots her a look: and that’s a shock to you)
Totally understandable given the circumstances.
(a beat)
Which is why, I think seeing your Mom would be really good for you.
LUCAS
Jess, that is pretty much the worst idea you’ve ever had.
JESSIE
Please, I’ve had WAY worse ideas. (a beat)
Come on, Lucas. You know you want to see her?
LUCAS
What difference does that make? (motioning to his egregious hulking frame)
How do you plan to explain all this, genius?
JESSIE
We won’t have to. (confident)
Trust me. I got a plan.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EDGE OF WOODS - CONTINUOUS
We hear the sound of LIGAMENTS CRACKING and TEARING coming from a overgrowth of brush at the edge of the park.
PUSH IN ON OVERGROWTH - A large mass is moving inside the shadows. A scattering of yellow eyes appear in the darkness. SNIKT! A large, blade-like talon SLIDES INTO THE SUNLIGHT - then retracts back into the shadows.
INT. JESSIE'S BEDROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER
Lucas is standing in front of the mirror beside Jessie. He’s squeezed himself into one of Jessie’s Dad’s sweatsuits. It barely covers his BULGING muscles.
JESSIE
(re: Lucas’s muscles)
Did they feed you like small humans in the future?
LUCAS
This is a bad idea.
JESSIE
Not it’s not - and please, you look awesome.
(MORE)
JESSIE (CONT'D)
May we all experience the butterfly- like transformation puberty had on you.
Jessie finishes the TEXT she’s been composing on her cellphone.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
OK, so you’re my cousin’s brother- in-law from Spain, in town helping my Dad with the kitchen re-model.
(a beat)
As soon as we get inside your mom’s house, I’ll introduce you and run upstairs to grab your computer.
That should give you three or four minutes to see her.
Lucas shakes his head.
LUCAS
I can’t believe I’m agreeing to do this.
CAMILLE (O.S.) DITCHING SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, SHE-WOLF?
Jessie SPINS to her door: CRAP.
CAMILLE (O.S.) (CONT’D) DAD’S GONNA BE SO PISSED!
Jessie LOCKS HER DOOR and leans her back up against it. She notices that Lucas has PICKED UP HIS RIFLE.
JESSIE
(quietly, reassuringly) It’s just my sister.
LUCAS
Exactly.
EXT. JESSIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Camille (wearing Volleyball gear) stands outside Jessie’s door.
CAMILLE
I’d be hiding out if I’d made a video like that too.
(golf claps with a LAUGH) Bravo!
She tries to open the door.
CAMILLE (CONT’D) OPEN YOUR DOOR!
INT. JESSIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
JESSIE
(fighting a panic attack) I... I’m not dressed!
CAMILLE (O.S.)
Do you have a boy in there with you? Your creepy special needs BFF doesn’t count.
Lucas COCKS his rifle.
LUCAS
(to Jessie)
Just let me do it. Please.
JESSIE
(whispering) STOP IT!
(to Camille)
I’m not feeling well.
CAMILLE (O.S.)
(really enjoying this)
The thought of you having to walk the hallways of school all day is just too glorious a vision not to witness so... get your clothes on and let’s go.
INTERCUT FOR DOOR CONVERSATION
JESSIE
Camille, seriously. I can’t go back to school right now.
CAMILLE
OK. I’ll just call Dad and let him deal with it.
JESSIE
Camille, I’m begging you. Please don’t do this.
CAMILLE
Why?
JESSIE
Because somewhere inside your soul there is a tiny sliver of compassion?
Camille contemplates her next move.
CAMILLE
What jar did Dad put the $40 in?
JESSIE
(relenting) The copper one.
CAMILLE
You’re cleaning my room and washing ALL my Volleyball gear.
JESSIE
(cringing) Done.
CAMILLE
Also... Nikki’s having a party tonight, so I’m gonna spend the weekend at her house. I’m gonna leave my cellphone in my room, so when Dad tracks me on Life360, it looks like I’m home.
(firm)
Make sure it stays charged.
JESSIE
I will.
CAMILLE
You’re lucky I’m feeling generous today.
JESSIE
(sarcastic)
I am a lucky little girl.
Jessie EXHALES as Camille STOMPS AWAY O.S.
LUCAS
Why do you let her treat you like that?
JESSIE
It’s an act of compassion. Feeling superior is the only way her minuscule brain produces dopamine.
(to the point)
Now, we’re in the middle of a mission to save the world and I need to help my traumatized best friend feel better, so...
She grabs her Jacket.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Let’s get over to your house and let the healing begin.
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD CUL DE SAC - DUSK
Lucas stands beside Jessie on the sidewalk overcome with emotions as he stares at his house.
LUCAS
God... It hasn’t changed a bit.
JESSIE
Uh... Because, you left it for school this morning.
Lucas nods, remembering this is the same day he vanished. Jessie puts a confident hand on his shoulder.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(reassuring)
Relax. This is gonna be great.
INT. LUCAS’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
Abby is pouring herself a GLASS OF WINE at the island in the kitchen. The doorbell RINGS O.S.
ABIGAIL
(over her shoulder) DOOR’S OPEN, JESS!
Abby’s back is to Jessie and Lucas as they enter the kitchen. She turns around to greet them and Lucas’s heart practically BURSTS OUT OF HIS CHEST. She takes in Lucas’s muscular frame.
ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
(to Jessie)
Whoa... I didn’t know there was a side of your family that experimented with Gamma Rays?
She CHUCKLES at her own ”nerd joke”. She’s a little tipsy. Jessie makes introductions.
JESSIE
(to Abby)
Mrs. Moke, this is my cousin-in- law, Jake.
Lucas stares at Abby, fighting the urge NOT to cry.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(to Lucas)
Jake, this my best friend’s mother, Abigail Moke.
ABIGAIL
(to Lucas) It’s just Abby.
(MORE)
ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
(extending her hand to shake)
It’s nice to meet you, Jake.
Lucas bypasses her hand and gives her a HUG. Jessie cringes: this was not the start she was hoping for. Lucas won’t let go.
JESSIE
(covering for Lucas’s behavior)
They’re big huggers on his side of the family.
ABIGAIL
It’s all good.
Abby doesn’t seem to mind being hugged by such a big, strapping man.
JESSIE
(slightly concerned)
OK, well... I’m gonna grab Lucas’s computer real FAST, and we’ll be out of here.
ABIGAIL
(re: Lucas’s bedroom)
OK. Good luck in there! Lucas’s bedroom is like an episode of American Horror Story.
Jessie quickly disappears upstairs. Abby, still clutched in Lucas’s embrace, awkwardly PATS HIS BACK.
ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
OK then.
This makes Lucas just SQUEEZE HER TIGHTER. The color begins to DRAIN FROM HER FACE.
ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
(struggling)
Getting a... little... hard to... breath.
Lucas realizes what he’s doing and RELEASES his grip.
LUCAS
I’m so...
(faking an accent)
...sorry.
ABIGAIL
(catching her breath)
It’s OK. I mean who doesn’t love a good hug?
(MORE)
ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
(self-deprecating)
You’re just very strong. Girlfriend here needs to get back to the gym.
LUCAS
(emotional)
What? No. You look perfect.
ABIGAIL
(blushing)
Why... Thank you, Jake.
She takes a sip of wine, not used to flattery.
ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
(enchanted)
You’re not too bad yourself.
Lucas smiles, too enamored seeing his mom to pick up on her subtle innuendo.
ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
So, how’s the renovation going?
Lucas stares at her, confused.
ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
In Jessie’s kitchen?
LUCAS
(remembering) Oh... Yes...
(fake accent)
It is going good.
ABIGAIL
So, are you a professional contractor?
LUCAS
(fake accent)
You bet.
(playing along)
If you ever need any work done around here, just let me know.
(a beat)
I’m real good at hammering things in.
ABIGAIL
(flirtatiously)
Well, how soon can you start?
Lucas BLINKS. Was that flirting? The reality of the situation hits him like train.
LUCAS Oh... my...
JESSIE (O.C.)
OK!
Jessie BOUNDS into the kitchen with Lucas’s computer.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
We’re all set!
ABIGAIL
(re: computer)
I’m impressed you found anything in Lucas’s room.
JESSIE
(re: Lucas’s bedroom)
Yeah, that was pretty traumatizing.
She returns to Lucas, whose trying not to loose it.
ABIGAIL
(to Lucas)
Well, it was really nice to meet you Jake.
(a beat)
Feel free to stop buy later, if you want to wind down with a little wine.
She playfully winks. Lucas DRY HEAVES.
JESSIE
(urgent) Time to go!
She grabs Lucas’s arm and starts pulling his to the front door.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
I’ll tell Lucas you said “hi” Mrs. Moke. OK, bye bye then!
The door SLAMS CLOSED behind them.
INT. JESSIE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
Lucas is PACING on the far side of Jessie’s bed, mortified. Jessie stands across from him looking very guilty.
JESSIE
Well, that didn’t go quite the way I hoped.
Lucas shoots her an accusatory look.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(defensive)
Hey, I’m not the one who decided to be the stud who likes to hug!
LUCAS
(pales) Oh my God...
She POINTS to his computer resting on her bed trying to change the subject
JESSIE
Hey, at least we got your computer! What do you say we get back to finding Mcau...
Lucas looks like he’s gonna lose it.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
OK, Lucas. Just take a few deep breaths.
LUCAS
(trying to avoid a total meltdown)
Jessie, I need you need to start talking about something else.
OK. Uh...
JESSIE
LUCAS (CONT'D)
Like right NOW!
Jessie scans the room and points to Lucas’s rifle on her desk.
JESSIE
Tell me about your rifle?
LUCAS
MX-19 pulse rifle. Fusion core, thermal tip rounds with cell-based neutronic tracking.
(to himself)
This is working. Just gotta clear the mind...
(loosing it)
Oh god... She invited me over for a nightcap!
JESSIE
Stay with me Lucas! (thinking fast)
Uh... The Klathorians! Tell me about the Klathorians? What do they look like?
LUCAS
Reptilian-like humanoids with adaptable DNA that allows them to adjust their appearance to look human.
(continuing)
Ugly when they’re not mirroring human form.
JESSIE
(keeping him going)
So, was it cool killing them? Did their heads explode and shit?
Lucas stares at her, incredulous.
LUCAS
What? There’s nothing “cool” about killing anything.
(bleak) It was war.
Jessie’s hit a nerve. She nods apologetically.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Well...
(remorseless) Except maybe Lugorcs.
JESSIE
What’s a Lugorc?
SMASH! The window to Jessie’s room EXPLODES and a LUGORC (A huge half wolf, half ant-like beast with a scattering of beady yellow eyes buried between the muscular shoulders holding up it’s massive arms) comes FLYING IN! It LANDS on the bed between them, CRUSHING Lucas’s laptop under its talon tipped hooves!
LUCAS THAT’S A LUGORC!
The Lugorc turns to Jessie. SKNIKT! Several BLADE-LIKE TALONS SPRING from its bulking forearms.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(to Jessie: screaming) DUCK!
Jessie ducks - BARELY MISSING THE TALONS that would have REMOVED HER HEAD. Lucas locks eyes on his rifle. The Lugorc is standing between him and it - blocking his path. The beast rears back to STRIKE Jessie again.
LUCAS (CONT’D) HERE! YOU WANT ME!
The beast SPINS to Lucas - who LAUNCHES himself at it LIKE A LINEBACKER!
INT. JESSIE’S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
BOOM! Lucas and the Lugorc EXPLODE out Jessie’s bedroom door into the hallway. Lucas DRIVES AN ELBOW into the beast’s face
- stunning it for a moment. He SCRAMBLES to his feet and RACES DOWN THE HALLWAY.
LUCAS
Come on!
As Lucas reaches the staircase, the Lugorc BRANDISHES ITS TALONS and LEAPS for him! Lucas drops as the Lugorc reaches him and DRIVES HIS FOOT into its MID-SECTION!
It FLIES over his head with a YELP but manages to hook a talon on Lucas’s shoulder - PULLING HIM DOWN THE STAIRCASE BEHIND HIM!
INT. JESSIE’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
They BURST through the bannister and TUMBLE across the living room floor!
LUCAS
(screaming)
JESSIE! GET ME MY RIFLE! INT. JESSIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jessie grabs Lucas’s rifle off her desk. INT. JESSIE’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The Lugorc LUNGES for Lucas. He picks up a piece of the busted bannister and SMASHES IT ACROSS ITS FACE!
LUCAS
(out-of-breath)
MAKE SURE YOU RELEASE THE SAFETY!
EXT. JESSIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jessie looks over the massive rifle as she RUNS DOWN the hall.
JESSIE WHERE IS IT?
INT. JESSIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Lucas LEAPS over the dining room table and heads for the kitchen as the disoriented Lugorc gets to its feet.
LUCAS
THE BLUE BUTTON ON THE BACK!
INT. JESSIE’S STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
Jessie flips the rifle over trying to find the blue button.
JESSIE
(frustrated) What blue button?
LUCAS (O.S.)
JESSIE!!!
INT. JESSIE’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Lucas reaches the door to the kitchen as the Lugorc DIVES for him! He LEAPS UP, grabbing onto the doorframe and TUCKS HIS LEGS UP UNDER HIME. The Lugorc SAILS underneath him and FLIES INTO THE KITCHEN!
INT. JESSIE’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
It CRASHES through the island and SLAMS into the refrigerator. It BURSTS open sending food EVERYWHERE!
Lucas SWINGS DOWN from the doorframe and grabs a blade from a knife rack when the Lugorc lets out a BLOOD-CURDLING CRY!
Some kind of WHITE LIQUID is EATING through the Lugorc’s head like ACID! Lucas watches, bewildered as Jessie FLIES into the kitchen with his rifle!
LUCAS
It’s OK. It’s dead.
He takes his rifle from Jessie.
JESSIE
What is that thing?
LUCAS
Lugorc. Genetically designed Klathorian assassin.
She covers her nose, GAGGING from the creature’s FOUL STENCH.
JESSIE
What did you do to it?
LUCAS
(confused)
I didn’t do anything?
Lucas steps over to the beast, SCOOPS some of the white liquid off its melted head and SNIFFS IT. He then TASTES it.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(surprised) Milk?
JESSIE
Milk kills those things?
LUCAS
(matter of fact)
That makes a lot more sense now. (off Jessie’s confused look)
The first thing the Klathorians targeted when they attacked were our dairy farms.
Lucas EJECTS a pen-sized needle from the side of his rifle and JAMS IT into the dead Lugorc’s NECK.
JESSIE
(re: needle) What are you doing?
LUCAS
Analyzing it’s codex to see how many more we’re facing.
JESSIE
(concerned) More?
LUCAS
Aside from the stench, Lugorcs can self-replicate. If you’ve got one in the morning, you’ll have dozens by the end of the day.
JESSIE
You mean like Gremlins?
LUCAS
No, I don’t mean like Gremlins!
Lucas pauses for a moment.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Well... Yeah, sort of like Gremlins.
(re: Lugorc)
Point is, they aren't that hard to kill individually but they’re practically unstoppable in packs.
His rifle BEEPS! Two orange dots POP UP on his TRACKING DISPLAY.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Two more. Not too far from the High School.
He removes the needle and INSERTS IT back into his RIFLE.
JESSIE
(excited)
We’re going after them? Lucas nods. Jessie stands excited.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Yes!
(a beat)
Wait... What am I supposed to fight them with?
Lucas DETACHES the front section of his rifle. He HANDS it to Jessie, PRESSES a button on its side and a HANDLE POPS OUT: it’s a PISTOL.
LUCAS
Be careful with that.
Jessie holds the gun like she’s won the lottery.
JESSIE
This is the best day ever...
She accidentally SQUEEZES the trigger! TA-BLAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! Lucas DUCKS as BULLETS SHRED THE CABINET behind him! Jessie RELEASES her grip and smiles sheepishly.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Oops.
He RIPS the pistol out of her hand and SLAMS IT back into his rifle.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
It was an accident!
Lucas heads out of the kitchen.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Really!?!?
(exasperated)
Well, what am I supposed to fight them with?
Lucas GRABS an unopened jug of milk off the counter and PLOPS IT in her hand.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(sarcastic distain) Awesome.
EXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
Lucas (back in his armor) RUNS past the outdoor exercise equipment with his rifle at the ready. Jessie is close behind, looking idiotic carrying the milk jug. LUCAS CHECKS HIS TRACKING DISPLAY.
LUCAS
Ten meters.
He gives Jessie a complicated HAND SIGNAL.
JESSIE
(confused)
What was that? Jazz hands?
LUCAS
(EXHALING annoyed)
Just stay here, I’ll be right back.
Lucas disappears. Jessie leans against a tree, a bit annoyed to be left out. Dexter SUDDENLY FLOATS BY in the PLASMA BUBBLE. His face still frozen in a silent scream. Jessie smiles.
JESSIE
That is a truly beautiful sight.
Jessie hears the SOUND OF STRUGGLE in the distance, TWO LASER SHOTS, then everything gets silent. Too silent.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(nervously) LUCAS?
She GAGS as a RANCID smell wafts past her.
With a gulp, she slowly turns to the Lugorc standing behind her. It SLIDES it’s TALON out with a menacing SKNIKT! Jessie shuts her eyes. She GRIPS the milk jug TIGHT IN HER HAND, finding her courage.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(to herself)
You can do this Jess.
She opens her eyes, staring into the beast’s face.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(with a smirk) Got Milk?
She THRUSTS the jug of milk at the Lugorc but nothing happens. She looks down and grimaces - the cap is still on.
BOOM - the SIDE of the beasts HEAD EXPLODES and it COLLAPSES to the ground. Lucas steps out from behind it.
LUCAS
(re: Jessie’s Milk)
Probably a good idea to make sure the cap’s off next time.
Jessie gives him the finger. He CHUCKLES then FIRES a few more rounds in the Lugorc.
JESSIE
(re: dead Lugorc) We get all of them?
LUCAS
(checking his display)
I think so, but my tracker only has a range of about 4 miles.
Jessie looks down at the dead Lugorc.
JESSIE
How did that thing know where you were?
LUCAS
I don’t know? Lugorcs use blood to track their targets...
He TOUCHES his neck where the misquote had bit him.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
That’s what bit me!
He searches the grass and finds a small exoskeleton. He picks it up.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(NODS to himself)
Must have hit me with a spore before I came back through that temporal rift.
JESSIE
A spore?
LUCAS
Lugorcs are maggot sized at first. Easier for the Klathorians to hit their targets that way.
JESSIE
Does this mean the Klathorians are here?
LUCAS
I don’t know... He looks around nervously.
LUCAS (CONT'D)
But we’re not waiting around to find out.
(serious)
We need to find Mcauliffe, now.
JESSIE
Are we talking the last resort here?
Lucas NODS. Jessie EXHALES, disgruntled.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Fine. But we’re making a pitstop first.
(lifting up her milk jug) I’m not walking around with this all night.
INT. JESSIE’S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
ECU - The top of an old TOY BOX is RIPPED OPEN. White liquid is poured into a brightly colored plastic receptacle. SQUIRT, SQUIRT! Milk SPLATTERS against a wall.
WIDE - Jessie lowers a SUPER SOAKER WATER GUN filled with MILK and nods with a confident smile.
INT. JESSIE'S KITCHEN - LATER
Several flies SWARM around the dead Lugorc lying on the Kitchen floor. The dead creatures stomach TWITCHES.
WE PUSH IN as something begins to move inside it towards the exposed flesh of its headless neck. SPLURT - a disgusting, membraned covered placenta BURSTS out and FLOPS onto the floor. Something in a “fetal” position inside it BEGINS TO MOVE.
EXT. FREDDY BERN’S GARAGE - NIGHT
Freddy stares into frame with a defiant look on his face. He’s sporting camouflage make-up, a military throat mic and holding an air-soft rifle.
FREDDY
No.
WIDE - Jessie is standing across from him, outside his garage. Her Super Soaker is slung over her shoulder now.
JESSIE
You’re joking, right?
FREDDY
How am I supposed to promise not to talk about something if I don’t even know what it is?
JESSIE
Because that’s the whole point of a secret, Freddy!
(a beat)
Come on. This is fate of the world stuff here. Don’t be a dick.
FREDDY
A dick.
He turns indignantly.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
Well, good luck finding a fast computer, Jess.
LUCAS (O.C.)
We don’t have time for this.
Lucas EMERGES from the shadows. He GRABS Freddy and PINS HIM AGAINST HIS DOOR!
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(annoyed) Listen you little...
REN O.S.
Freddy?
They turn to the terrified face of REN (8, Freddy’s bratty little sister) - who’s also wearing camouflage make-up and holding a air-soft gun. Jessie tries to defuse the situation.
JESSIE
(calm)
Hey Ren. Wow, look at you all decked out?
Her LIP BEGINS to TREMBLE with fear.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
This isn’t what you think. We’re just having a little fun.
She OPENS HER MOUTH to scream.
JESSIE (CONT'D)
REN, NO, NO--
PIIISSST!!! Lucas BLASTS some kind of mist from his rifle INTO HER FACE. She blinks and COLLAPSES to the ground with a THUD.
A trickle of pee RUNS DOWN Freddy’s leg. His eyes ROLL UP INTO HIS HEAD and he PASSES OUT in Lucas’s arms. Jessie glares at Lucas annoyed.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
And that was the best idea you could come up with!?
INT. FREDDY BERN’S HOUSE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
Lucas and Jessie sit on a couch across from Freddy - who’s awake. He finishes GULPING DOWN a glass a water.
LUCAS
Stay hydrated. The adrenaline booster I gave you is very strong stuff.
FREDDY
Sorry, I passed out again.
JESSIE
(pointedly) Third time, Freddy.
FREDDY
(defensively)
That was a lot of info to take in.
He glances over at Ren - who’s propped on the couch beside him unconscious.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
Is that permanent?
LUCAS
No. She’ll wake up in a few hours.
FREDDY
Damn it.
Jessie points to Freddy’s throat mic.
JESSIE
Where the hell did you get military grade throat mics?
FREDDY
(matter-of-fact) China.
LUCAS
Listen Freddy, seeing as time is not exactly on our side right now, maybe you can get to finding Mcauliffe?
Freddy puts on his “game face”.
FREDDY
Right. You were smart coming to me. Most people only use 10% of their brain.
(cocky)
I’m pretty sure I’m clocking in at 19%.
Jessie floats Lucas a sour gaze as Freddy SLIDES over to his computer.
JESSIE
(under her breath)
This is why I said last resort.
Freddy begins furiously TYPING into his keyboard.
FREDDY
(”meth” fast)
The search algorithm I’m about to use is crazy efficient. Designed it myself. Uses key-strokes and available facial recognition to narrow the search. Google’s already approached me about buying it.
Jessie and Lucas share a surprised look.
JESSIE
Really?
FREDDY
I keep things close to the hip so people don’t get overwhelmed.
(cocky)
Feel free to look away if your eyes start to burn.
Jessie rolls her eyes.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
(over his shoulder)
Wow... The stimulant you gave me is really starting to kick in, Lucas.
(buzzing)
I’m feel kinda invincible.
LUCAS
(little worried)
Well, just remember that you’re not.
JESSIE
(to Lucas, under his breath)
(MORE)
JESSIE (CONT'D)
How strong was the stuff you used on him?
LUCAS
Designed to re-start a human heart.
JESSIE
(sarcastic) This should be fun.
INT. FREDDY’S GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Lucas is standing by a window holding an old IN-N-OUT burger box. He’s SMELLING it with reverence. Jessie approaches as he digs a stale fry from the corner and pops it in his mouth.
Jessie is about to say something when she sees that the fry has transported him to a happier place.
JESSIE
(soft)
Been a long time since you’ve had one of those, huh?
(Lucas nods)
Well, then you should enjoy this, too.
She hands him a Coke-Zero.
LUCAS
Thanks.
(motioning to Freddy) How’s it coming?
ANGLE ON FREDDY - He’s WAILING AWAY on his keyboard in a POOL OF SWEAT.
JESSIE
Well... I think I finally understand the dangers of meth.
LUCAS
You should get some sleep.
JESSIE
Are you kidding? I’m not gonna sleep again for the rest of my life.
Lucas understands that statement far to well and checks the tracking display on his rifle. Jessie holds her gaze on him. It’s the first time she’s seeing a man who was literally in BATTLE a FEW HOURS AGO.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(softly)
You wanna talk about it?
LUCAS
Talk about what?
JESSIE
What happened to you in the future? The War?
LUCAS
Not really.
Jessie nods, respecting his space. After a beat, she can’t help but ask the question that’s been burning her up inside:
JESSIE
You gotta tell me... Are all my movies like mega blockbusters in the future?
Lucas looks away, trying to avoid the conversation.
LUCAS
Wasn’t... a lot of time to be making movies.
JESSIE
(remembering)
Right... Because you and I were too busy fighting the Klathorians together.
Lucas forces a smile.
LUCAS
(lying) Till the end.
Jessie stares at Lucas.
JESSIE
You’re lying.
LUCAS
(lying) No, I’m not.
JESSIE
Yes, you are.
(a beat)
Something bad happened to me in the future, didn’t it?
(Lucas is silent)
It’s OK Lucas, you can tell me.
LUCAS
I...
(with tactful sensitivity) (MORE)
LUCAS (CONT'D)
Look Jessie, we’re attempting to change the course of history right now. We’re in uncharted waters here. There’s no way to predict what might happen if we succeed or don’t succeed.
JESSIE
I know.
LUCAS
(delicate)
So it doesn’t matter what happened. If we succeed, we’ll change it anyway but...
(a beat)
If for some reason something bad happens to me...
JESSIE
(the optimist)
Nothing bad is going to happen to you, Lucas. We’re gonna find Mcauliffe and save the world.
LUCAS
Just promise me you won’t tell anyone the truth about what really happened to me. No matter what.
JESSIE
What do you mean?
LUCAS
If someone asks you how I disappeared, just make something up. Say I ran away or something. Don’t tell the authorities the truth.
JESSIE
What? Did they lock me up in an mental institution or something?
LUCAS
(ignoring the question) Just promise me you won’t tell anyone the truth.
Jessie’s never seen Lucas so serious before.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(earnest and vulnerable) Please.
JESSIE
(nodding) I promise.
LUCAS
Thank you--
FREDDY (O.C.)
--Found him!
They turn to Freddy.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
(reading off his screen) Daniel Ryan Mcauliffe. Born March 31st, 1978. Physicist specializing in quantum dynamics, astro-physics and wave theory.
They RUN OVER and view Freddy’s computer.
LUCAS
You might just be using 19%, Freddy!
FREDDY
(beaming)
That’s not even the best part. He works right here in Santa Clarita.
JESSIE
What?
Freddy pulls SURVEILLANCE VIDEO of the WESTFORD LABORATORIES
up on-screen. High concrete fences surround the place. One road in and out - with double checkpoints.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Is that Westford Laboratories?
FREDDY
Yup.
(concerned)
Hope you have a plan to get in there, cause that place has serious security.
Lucas lifts his rifle and COCKS it with bravado.
LUCAS
I call this my universal key.
JESSIE
Whoa! You can’t just blast your way in there?
LUCAS
Jessie, we have to stop Mcauliffe.
JESSIE
Agreed. But we can do it without hurting innocent people.
FREDDY (O.C.)
(re: his monitor) Is that Mrs. Wu?
They turn to Freddy’s computer. The SURVEILLANCE VIDEO is showing Madison EXITING the guard gate in a souped up Chevy Charger. Lucas stares at Madison.
LUCAS
Man, I forgot how beautiful she was.
FREDDY
(agreeing) So hot.
Jessie DRY HEAVES.
LUCAS
What’s she doing there?
FREDDY
(remembering to Jessie)
Isn’t Westford Labs where Mrs. Wu’s taking us for the field trip on Monday?
ANGLE ON SURVEILLANCE VIDEO - Madison swipes an ACCESS CARD
by the guard station. The gate opens and she drives away.
JESSIE
She’s got an access card.
LUCAS
(to Freddy) Can you track her?
FREDDY
(offended) Is that a joke?
Lucas GETS UP.
LUCAS
(to Freddy)
I need to borrow your car.
FREDDY
(confused) What?
Lucas remembers that he’s talking to a 14 year old.
LUCAS
Never mind. I’ll just jump start a car on the street.
JESSIE
We’re stealing a car?
FREDDY
We’re stealing a car!?
Freddy HOPS UP, excited. Lucas puts a hand on Freddy, and gently PUSHES HIM BACK DOWN into his chair.
LUCAS
(to Freddy)
You are not stealing anything. (a beat)
You are staying right here.
FREDDY
(pissed) What? Why?
LUCAS
(reaching) Because... Uh...
Jessie jumps in to defuse the situation.
JESSIE
Because, we need that brilliant mind of yours on your computer in case something goes wrong.
(laying it on thick) You’re our Dustin from Stranger Things now.
Freddy POPS the equivalent of a GEEK BONER.
FREDDY
Consider your backs covered, Elle. (to Lucas)
You too, Chief.
INT. JESSIE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT
The membraned placenta we saw earlier, lays PEELED OPEN on the kitchen floor. The dead Lugorc is nowhere to be seen.
A slim trail is leading to a pantry in the corner. The sounds of CHEWING are COMING FROM IT.
WE PUSH IN on the dark pantry - just in time to see the DEAD LUGORC’S LEG get PULLED INSIDE. We hear several CRACKS and a LOUD GULP - then watch a shapeless form begin to RISE UP in the darkness. It’s muscles SHIFT and CRACK as it begins to take on a HUMAN FORM.
The THING reaches into its MOUTH and PULLS out a small, MULTI- TENTACLED LARVA. It SQUIRMS and lets out a VENOMOUS SHRIEK!
INT. STOLEN SEDAN - LOCAL BAR - LATER
Jessie and Lucas sit in a stolen car, in the PARKING LOT of a local bar.
LUCAS
That Stranger Things move on Freddy was pretty impressive.
JESSIE
You’ve clearly forgotten who our friends are? Their geek sensibilities will overcome their rational minds, every time.
Jessie’s cell RINGS.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(listening)
Yeah... OK... Nice work, Dustin.
She puts the phone down and motions to the bar.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Freddy said Mrs. Wu went into the Bar five minutes ago.
(Lucas NODS) So what’s the plan?
LUCAS
(surveying the bar)
Go in and get her access card.
JESSIE
How?
LUCAS
I don’t know Jessie? In a non- lethal way.
He hands Jessie his rifle.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(re: his rifle)
Try not to shoot yourself.
Lucas HOPS OUT of the car with a CHUCKLE and heads for the bar. Jessie CALLS to him, as he nears the entrance.
JESSIE (O.C.)
LUCAS!
(he turns to her) Stay focused.
(MORE)
JESSIE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
Don’t let your “feelings” get you all distracted in there.
LUCAS
I’m aware of what’s at stake here.
She and POINTS to his CLOAK.
JESSIE
Your armor is showing.
Lucas catches his reflection in a car window. He adjusts his cloak to cover his armor - then briefly FIXES HIS HAIR. Jessie GLARES at him, nauseated.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
I swear to god, I’m gonna throw up on you.
INT. LOCAL BAR - CONTINUOUS
Lucas ENTERS the empty bar and surveys the room. Madison is sitting alone at the bar, nursing a beer. He sits down beside her.
BARTENDER
(to Lucas) What can I get you?
LUCAS
Oh, uh...
Madison looks at him and smiles. He kinda melts.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
I’ll take what she’s having.
The Bartender nods and steps away.
MADISON
Sorry.
(re: her drink of choice) It’s light beer.
LUCAS
Oh... That’s fine with me.
Madison takes in his appearance for a moment.
MADISON
Do you have a circulation problem?... Or do you always walk around dressed like a Jedi?
Lucas LAUGHS.
LUCAS
Jedi.
(wry)
That’s why I’m usually drinking alone.
Madison LAUGHS and points to herself.
MADISON
(consolatory)
The nerd runs deep here too.
She shows Lucas a Leeloo Dallas’ multipass replica that’s hanging from the lanyard she’s wearing (that’s also holding her access card).
LUCAS
(impressed)
Is that a Leeloo Dallas multipass from The Fifth Element?
(Madison nods with pride) That’s next level geek right there.
MADISON
(with a wink) Still in the closet.
LUCAS
(re: multipass replica) You get that at comic-con or something?
MADISON
I wish. Amazon. (a beat)
I’ve actually never left the Santa Clarita Valley.
LUCAS
Really?
She nods. It’s not something she’s proud of.
MADISON
Born and raised here. Married my high school sweetheart, work as a teacher at the high-school, the whole shebang.
LUCAS
(slightly disappointed) You’re married?
MADISON
What!? No. God no! (clear)
Divorced. Very Divorced.
(MORE)
MADISON (CONT'D)
(a beat)
Why, you looking for a girlfriend?
She blinks.
MADISON (CONT’D)
I said that out-loud, didn’t I?
Lucas nods. She smiles, innocently embarrassed.
LUCAS
Not complaining.
Lucas smiles. The chemistry between these two is palpable.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
How did I not know you were such a huge geek?
MADISON
How could you?
An uncomfortable beat passes between them.
MADISON (CONT’D)
(a little unnerved) Uh... I’m sorry, have we met before?
INT. STOLEN SEDAN - CONTINUOUS
Jessie checks her watch impatiently.
JESSIE
Come on, Lucas.
A FLASHLIGHT shines in her face. A cop car has pulled up beside her.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(under her breath) Crap.
The officer MOTIONS for Jessie to roll down her window. She complies.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Evening officer.
POLICE OFFICER
Evening.
JESSIE
How can I help you?
POLICE OFFICER
Your car matches the description of one that was reported stolen about an hour ago.
Jessie nervously smiles.
JESSIE
(re: stolen car)
Well, I guess someone else also has good taste.
She PATS THE DASHBOARD confidently.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
‘Cause this bad boy is all mine.
The officer STEPS OUT and approaches her door.
POLICE OFFICER
If I could just see your license and registration anyways.
(a beat)
I’d hate to arrest the wrong person.
JESSIE
Absolutely.
Jessie reaches for the glove box when - she sees an ORANGE TARGET moving on the TRACKING DISPLAY of Lucas’s rifle.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Oh no....
INT. LOCAL BAR - CONTINUOUS
Lucas stares at Madison, not sure what to say.
MADISON
Do we know each other?
LUCAS
Well, that’s kind of a loaded question...
Madison involuntarily GAGS and covers her nose.
MADISON
What is that smell?
Lucas snaps to attention. He REACHES INTO his cloak for his rifle then cringes: he left it with Jessie. He locks his eyes on Madison.
LUCAS
Madison, please don’t take this personally, but I’m gonna pick you up right now and toss you over this bar.
MADISON
Excuse me?
LUCAS
No matter what you hear, stay down.
Lucas GRABS Madison by her jacket and LITERALLY TOSSES HER OVER THE BAR. As she disappears behind it, he SPINS around, RIPS OFF his cloak and THROWS it over the head of THE LUGORC that’s CHARGING at him - blinding it’s multiple yellow eyes.
It SLAMS into the thick wood bar with a loud CRACK. Madison SCREAMS!
EXT. LOCAL BAR - CONTINUOUS
The Police Officer SPINS to the bar.
POLICE OFFICER
What the hell was that...
He TAKES OFF for the entrance. Jessie SCREAMS after him!
JESSIE DON’T GO IN THERE!
INT. LOCAL BAR - CONTINUOUS
Lucas JUMPS back, TWISTS A KNOB on his right gauntlet and a small grappling hook POPS INTO HIS HAND - a thin cable is attached to him. The Lugorc TEARS THE CLOAK from its head and LAUNCHES at Lucas. He THROWS the grappling hook at the beast WHILE IT’S AIRBORNE. The hook’s cable WRAPS AROUND the beast’s talon clad arm, then IMBEDS ITSELF into its leathery alien skin!
Using the Lugorc’s momentum, Lucas PULLS ON THE CABLE with both arms, SWINGING the beast around and LAUNCHING IT ACROSS THE ROOM! It CRASHES into the corner. He detaches the cable from his wrist and ANCHORS IT into a wood beam beside him.
Lucas then TAPS his outside thigh and two BATON SHAPED/KATANA BLADES POP OUT. He SWINGS them into fighting position and sees Madison, staring at him from behind the bar.
LUCAS
(over his shoulder) MADISON, STAY DOWN!
The police officer suddenly BURSTS into the bar and DRAWS his gun on Lucas.
POLICE OFFICER DROP YOUR WEAPON!
Lucas stares at him, incredulously.
LUCAS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
POLICE OFFICER DROP THEM NOW!!!
Lucas LIFTS HIS ARM to point at the Lugorc in the corner when... BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The officer FIRES THREE SHOTS into Lucas’s chest, sending him SLAMMING onto his back!
MADISON (O.C.)
LUCAS!!!!
A MENACING ROAR causes the Officer to SPIN to the corner: seeing the Lugorc for the first time.
POLICE OFFICER
What the...
He FIRES into its chest as it CHARGES HIM. His bullets have zero effect on its plated, shell-like chest. Madison SCREAMS as it DESCENDS on the officer with a ROAR. It TEARS INTO HIM for a few seconds then locks its seven beady yellow eyes on Madison and CHARGES.
Lucas SLIDES IN FRONT of the beast before it reaches the bar and DEFLECTS its arm with his BLADES. The Lugorc tries to SWING its other arm but can’t: the cable that Lucas anchored is STILL HOLDING IT BACK.
Seeing his advantage, Lucas SLASHES into the beast’s midsection landing numerous punishing STRIKES before the CABLE holding the Lugorc SNAPS.
The beast LAUNCHES forward, SLAMMING Lucas against the counter and SWINGS both talons down at his head.
CLANG! Lucas stops them with his blades - inches before they hit his face - but he’s PINNED. The Lugorc bears its weight down on him, pushing its talons CLOSER AND CLOSER to his face. Lucas glances at Madison - who’s watching from behind the counter.
LUCAS
(straining) M...ilk.
What?
MADISON
LUCAS
(straining) Milk  Please.
Madison doesn’t understand the request. Lucas shuts his eyes as a talon REACHES HIS FACE. This is it.
BLA-TAT-TAT-TAT! The Lugorc FLIES OFF Lucas and CRASHES to the floor in a bloody heap.
JESSIE stands a few feet away - the barrel of Lucas’s rifle she’s holding SMOKES.
JESSIE
(triumphantly) Found the blue button.
Lucas SLIDES to the floor, relieved.
LUCAS
(exhausted)
I really love you right now, Jessie.
MADISON
Jessie Chase?
Jessie casually WAVES at Madison.
JESSIE
Hi, Miss Wu.
MADISON
What... Are you doing here?
JESSIE
(cocky) Saving your ass.
Madison stares at the dead Lugorc.
MADISON
What the hell is that?
JESSIE
A Gremlin assassin from the future. (cringing to Lucas)
I wasn’t supposed to say that, was I?
LUCAS
(out-of-breath)
We’re gonna have to explain it all anyway.
Jessie nods and MOTIONS to the dead beast.
JESSIE
Guess we missed one?
Lucas NODS, heads over to the fallen police officer and examines his injuries.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Is he dead?
LUCAS
(relieved)
He had his vest on. Just surface wounds.
He PULLS a syringe-like medical device from his belt - and INJECTS something into the officer’s neck.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
That will speed up the healing and keep him unconscious for a couple of hours.
(to Jessie)
The last thing we need right now is Police involvement.
JESSIE
Agreed.
Madison stares at Lucas as he STANDS.
MADISON
Who are you?
LUCAS
Uh... Lucas Moke. (after a long beat)
What?
MADISON
JESSIE
(explaining)
He’s been in the future for 20 years, so he’s old now.
LUCAS
I’m not old.
Madison stares at Lucas, trying to process if he’s telling her the truth.
MADISON
(surprised)
Why do I believe you?
Lucas MOTIONS to the DESTRUCTION surrounding them: why wouldn’t you? Madison NODS, reaches behind the bar and HANDS LUCAS A GLASS OF MILK. He stares at it for a beat - then starts to LAUGH.
What?
MADISON (CONT’D)
Lucas TOSSES it on the Lugorc. Madison watches it MELT through the creature’s skin.
MADISON (CONT’D)
(apologetic) Sorry, about that.
LUCAS
It’s OK.
MADISON
So, are you going to explain what’s going on here?
LUCAS
Absolutely. But first, we need to borrow your Westford Lab access card.
Why?
MADISON
JESSIE
Would you believe us if we told you we needed it to save the world?
EXT. SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Madison’s car comes DRIFTING around a corner.
INT. MADISON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Jessie and Lucas HOLD ON for dear life.
LUCAS EASY MADISON!
MADISON
AHHHH!!!
JESSIE
YOU SAID WE’RE TRYING TO SAVE THE WORLD!
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Madison leads Lucas and Jessie down a hallway. They’re both a little frazzled from the ride.
JESSIE
(to Madison)
Jesus, is your last name Toretto?
LUCAS
(in agreement) Seriously.
(to Madison)
Where did you learn to drive like that?
MADISON
I teach a precision and stunt driving course twice a month for extra money.
(a beat)
A school teacher’s salary isn’t exactly something you can live on.
LUCAS
(re: her driving) Might be your true calling.
JESSIE
So, how do you know Mcauliffe anyway?
MADISON
I don’t, really. He’s just the person the facility put me in contact with for the field trip.
LUCAS
How dangerous is he?
Madison LAUGHS.
MADISON
He’s a little accident prone but far from dangerous.
(pointing) That’s his office.
They arrive outside Daniel’s office. His door is plastered with POST-IT NOTES and POLAROIDS.
JESSIE
Is that on purpose?
MADISON
(nodding)
Daniel’s got really bad A.D.D. Forgets stuff all the time so, he leaves himself lots of notes.
Lucas BANGS LOUDLY on the door.
LUCAS
MCAU...
JESSIE
Whoa! You’re gonna scare the hell out of him.
LUCAS
That’s kinda the point.
MADISON
(reassuring)
Trust me. He isn’t a threat. (re: the office door.)
May I?
She gently NUDGES Lucas to the side and RAPS on the door.
MADISON (CONT’D)
(sweetly)
Daniel? Hey, it’s Madison Wu!
INT. DANIEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Daniel’s wearing his huge headphones and can’t hear a thing.
MADSON (O.S.)
(louder) DANIEL!
He turns to his door, tearing off his headphones.
DANIEL
Hello?
MADISON (O.S.)
Daniel, it’s Madison Wu from Valencia High. Can you open the door, please?
DANIEL
Sure, hang on!...
He PUNCHES his security code into his door - and it slides open.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
(embarrassed)
Were you standing there lo...
Daniel STOPS as he sees Lucas and the large rifle he’s holding.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
(nervous)
Did Henry send you?
LUCAS
(going along with it) Sure did.
He smiles nervously, then CLOSES the door on their faces! EXT. DANIEL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Jessie turns to Lucas.
JESSIE
(sarcastic)
Yeah, that didn’t seem suspicious at all.
We hear Daniel’s door LOCK O.S. Madison RAPS on it.
MADISON
(annoyed)
DANIEL! OPEN THIS DOOR!
LUCAS
May I?
Lucas NUDGES Madison to the side and -- INT. DANIEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
-- KICKS the door open! They BURST into the office but Mcauliffe is gone. A door is SWINGING open at the back of the room. A CRASH O.S. pulls them back into the hallway.
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Lucas, Jessie and Madison watch Daniel - clamoring to his feet a few feet away, trying to stuff some papers back into his arms.
MADISON
What the hell are you doing?
He abandons the papers and makes a mad DASH for the exit! Lucas RIPS a futuristic-looking bolas off his utility belt and HURLS it at his legs. Daniel CRASHES onto his face.
JESSIE
(to Lucas)
You seriously have to let me try your armor out.
Lucas RUNS over and PULLS Daniel to his feet. Blood has begun to pour from his nose.
DANIEL
(pleading)
I’m sorry! Please don’t hurt me!
(MORE)
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Tell Henry I can get everything back to normal!
LUCAS
(intense) Where is it?
INT. DANIEL’S SECRET LAB - CONTINUOUS
Daniel leads the group into his secret lab. He motions to the towers.
DANIEL
That’s my Displacement Reactor.
Lucas steps to the towers, then turns to Daniel - flooded with emotion.
LUCAS
(angry)
Did it ever occur to you that maybe opening a wormhole might have some dire consequences?!
DANIEL
Wormhole?...
(confused)
What are you talking about?
JESSIE
The Mcauliffe Equation!
DANIEL
(confused) The Mc..
(excited)
That’s actually a really good name for it.
LUCAS
The experiment you’re going to do at 12:12AM!
DANIEL
(confused)
I’m not opening a wormhole.
He pauses for a moment - quickly refers to a note on his desk
- and nods confidently.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Yep, not opening a wormhole. (pointing to the towers)
At 12:12AM, I’m going to be the first scientist to successfully achieve teleportation!
JESSIE
Teleportation?
Daniel PULLS the CAPTAIN AMERICA ACTION FIGURE from his pocket.
DANIEL
Cap’s going to make history. Lucas and Jessie share a confused look.
JESSIE
What is he talking about?
DANIEL
Didn’t Henry tell you that? (suspicious)
Wait, how did you know what time I was planning to do my experiment?
MADISON
Because he’s from the future.
DANIEL
Oh... He’s what!?
MADISON
They’re here to stop you.
DANIEL
Stop me? Daniel SCREAMS.
LUCAS
Is this not the right guy?
JESSIE
It has to be.
DANIEL
WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!?
INT. DANIEL’S SECRET OFFICE - LATER
The group all stand around Daniel’s desk, WATCHING the end of the HOLOGRAM his older self had sent Lucas. The Mcauliffe Equation is displayed on his computer screen.
OLD MCAULIFFE (O.C.)
...re-write --- future. Save the human---!
The video ends. Daniel sits there trying to process everything.
DANIEL
(awestruck)
I can’t believe I created a stable wormhole... I mean, how AWESOME is that!?
(MORE)
DANIEL (CONT'D)
(a beat)
...but not.
MADISON
You aged really well.
DANIEL
(agreeing) I know, right?
LUCAS
So you’re saying, opening the wormhole was an accident?
DANIEL
(nodding)
Daniel returns to the Equation displayed on his computer screen.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
(amazed)
The fact that the blast wave was powerful enough to travel across time and send you into the future is just remarkable.
LUCAS
Wait... You know what sent me into the future?
DANIEL
Of course.
Clearly no one else does.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Right...
(explaining)
So, you know how when a bomb explodes, it releases a “shock wave” that can shatter windows miles away? Well, when this dimensional wormhole opened, its “shock wave” didn’t just blow out windows a few miles away, but cracked open a hole in the very fabric of TIME/SPACE itself...
(to Lucas)
A temporal fracture, in the exact spot where you just happened to be walking.
JESSIE
Wait... Are you saying anybody could have stepped into that thing and been sent to the future?
(off Daniel’s nod) So not fair.
LUCAS
So how did you send me back?
DANIEL
I don’t know.
(theorizing)
I must have found some way to punch you back into that temporal fracture...
(re: the equation.)
I’m sure the answer’s somewhere in there but, I mean, it doesn’t really matter. I’m not going to do that experiment tonight... Or ever.
MADISON
So, is that it?... Did we stop it? Daniel NODS. A beat passes between everyone.
JESSIE
(slightly disappointed)
Well, that’s anti-climactic. I was kinda hoping for some kind of epic final battle...
(everyone is staring at her)
But, I mean... It’s all good.
Lucas puts his hand on Jessie’s shoulder.
LUCAS
(proud) We did it.
She smiles. Madison notices Daniel staring at his computer -
a hint of sadness in his eyes.
MADISON
How long have you been working on that teleportation thing?
DANIEL
(bittersweet) My whole life.
MADISON
Sorry.
DANIEL
Hey, I’m not responsible for opening a gateway that let creatures into our world who destroyed the human race.
(a beat)
I’m feeling pretty good right now.
Jessie notices an odd looking clock on Daniel’s wall. The hands are spinning weirdly and the corner is drooping like a Salvador Dalí painting.
JESSIE
(re: clock, disturbed)
Was buying that like, a conscious choice?
Daniel turning to Lucas, ignores Jessie’s question
DANEIL
What happens now?
LUCAS
We destroy everything. That accelerator, all the data there is on the Equation.
(a beat)
Make sure this can never happen again.
DANIEL
(nodding)
Most of my data is on the hard- drives at my house. I’ll head there, first.
LUCAS
No. You stay here and start disassembling that accelerator.
Lucas suddenly BUCKLES weakly and DROPS to a knee.
MADISON
(worried) Lucas?
LUCAS
JESSIE
(concerned) Whoa... Are you OK?
Yeah, Yeah... Just got a little lightheaded all of a sudden.
He takes a DEEP BREATH and STANDS back up.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(to Daniel)
We’ll head to your house and destroy the drives.
(MORE)
LUCAS (CONT’D)
I wanna sweep the area and make sure we’re done with our Lugorc problem anyway.
DANIEL
(nervous)
Speaking of that... You mind leaving me something to protect myself with?
Lucas nods, removes the front section of his rifle - and hands Daniel the pistol.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Thanks.
LUCAS
We’ll see you soon.
Jessie gives Lucas a worried look as they head out.
JESSIE
Are you sure you’re OK? You look bad.
MADISON
(in agreement with Jessie) It’s true. When’s the last time you ate or had water or anything?
Lucas SHRUGS. Madison SCOFFS a little.
MADISON (CONT’D)
We need to get some food in you.
Jessie SMILES.
JESSIE
I know the perfect place.
INT. DANIEL MCAULIFFE’S HOUSE - LATER
Lucas, Jessie and Madison are sitting at a table in Daniel’s kitchen eating IN-N-OUT BURGERS. Madison is holding one of the numerous Polaroid cameras lying around Daniel’s kitchen.
Lucas and Jessie barley acknowledge Madison as they INHALE their food with EUPHORIC ECSTASY. Madison watches them amused.
MADISON
Glad you’re feeling better.
LUCAS
JESSIE
(nodding, mouth full) So... Good.
(nodding, mouth full) So... Good.
Jessie looks at Lucas as he eats. For the first time since all this started - he seems happy.
MADISON
(to Lucas)
You really made this list of things you’d do if you ever got back here... and having In-N-Out was at the top of your list?
Both Lucas and Jessie give Madison a shocked look. They LIFT up their burgers.
JESSIE
(chewing)
LUCAS
(chewing)
Uh... This is a Double Double with cheese.
Quite literally the greatest food ever created by humans.
Madison CHUCKLES as they continue to eat and aims the Polaroid camera at them.
MADISON
Smile.
Jessie makes a “peace sign” and Lucas flips a “hang-loose” as Madison SNAPS a shot of them.
INT. DANIEL’S SECRET LAB - NIGHT
Daniel finishes ATTACHING SOMETHING to the underside of his desk, then stares at The Mcauliffe Equation on his computer screen, still in awe of the marvel he created. His gaze suddenly shifts to the UPPER RIGHT CORNER of the monitor.
DANIEL
What in...
POV COMPUTER MONITOR - The right corner looks like it’s DETACHED - FLOATING an inch away from the rest of the computer - defying the very laws of physics. Daniel PUSHES against the detached section and the ENTIRE COMPUTER MOVES. It’s still one solid piece. A look of doom falls across his face as he LOOKS over at the clock on his wall Jessie had mentioned - seeing that it too is defying the laws of physics.
Oh God....
DANIEL (CONT’D)
He begins furiously TYPING into his keyboard.
INT. DANIEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Jessie admires the POLAROID Madison took of her and Lucas. There is a twinkle of youthful innocence in Lucas’s eyes again. She SLIDES the POLAROID into her JACKET POCKET with a sense of accomplishment.
MADISON
So, what happens now?
LUCAS
(chewing) What do you mean?
MADISON
I mean, how are you gonna explain to people what happened tomorrow? I mean you were fourteen this morning.
LUCAS
Well... I don’t think I’ll have to.
Jessie nods - completely in sync with Lucas’s thought process.
MADISON
What do you mean?
LUCAS
Well, I’m no time travel expert but... When McAuliffe doesn’t do the equation at 12:12AM - that temporal crack I walked through this morning will never appear and... This whole day will be erased.
MADISON
So, I won’t remember any of this?
JESSIE
(nodding)
Nobody will. It will be like it never happened.
Madison EXHALES relived.
MADISON
(to Lucas)
Well, at least I won’t have to feel guilty for wanting to go out with you.
Lucas practically CHOKES on his burger.
JESSIE
(grossed out)
Uh... I’m sitting right here.
LUCAS
(to Madison) You... Really?
She gives him an incredulous look: who wouldn’t want to hook- up with a man as hot as he is?
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Why would you feel guilty about that?
MADISON
Because you were my student this morning.
JESSIE (O.C.)
EXACTLY.
LUCAS
Yeah, but I’m not now? (a beat)
I’m like a man. A fully grown “man” man.
MADISON
(agreeing) Big time.
DANIEL suddenly BURSTS into the kitchen carrying the clock from his office.
DANIEL
(dire, out of breath)
Tell me you didn’t destroy my hard drives?
JESSIE
LUCAS
Daniel?
DANIEL
(frantic)
What are you doing here?
DID YOU DESTROY MY HARD DRIVES?
MADISON
No. We haven’t touched anything yet.
DANIEL
(exhales, relieved) Thank God.
MADISON
What’s going on?
DANIEL
(uncomfortable)
I uh... I’m gonna have to open up that wormhole again tonight.
JESSIE
LUCAS
WHAT!?
DANIEL
WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU DO THAT?
Because if I don’t I’m pretty sure we’ll destroy the universe as we know it.
Daniel DROPS the clock onto the table and POINTS.
JESSIE
(confused)
And you brought your weird ass clock, because?
DANIEL
It’s not just weird... It’s wrong. LOOK!
They LEAN IN and stare at the clock hands, spinning in a way that defies physics.
DANIEL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
The same thing is happening to a computer at my lab.
MADISON
What is that?
DANIEL
A part of our reality that’s already started to collapse.
That got their attention.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Look, when you guys left and I saw my computer, I opened the Mcauliffe Equation to see if something in the math might explain what was happening.
(a beat)
When I did, I discovered an anomaly in the sequencing... A piece of the math that didn’t fit.
(a beat)
I applied every variable I could think of to solve it, but nothing worked.
(a beat)
(MORE)
DANIEL (CONT’D)
That’s when I realized that the anomaly wasn’t in the math... It was in the quantum structure of the equation itself.
(to Lucas)
The anomaly... is you Lucas.
LUCAS
Me?
DANIEL
You. You’re the key to the whole thing!
(worried)
Lucas, when you stepped into that temporal fracture this morning, you weren’t just sent into the future, your body became entangled in the quantum fabric of the Equation itself... Your physical matter literally became a part of it.
(a beat)
That’s how the old me was able to send you back. He... I must have discovered the anomaly and realized that you were the only person who could re-enter that temporal fracture without collapsing it’s quantum state.
JESSIE
Am I the only person who’s totally lost here?
DANIEL
Think of Lucas like an organ transplant. If you needed a kidney and a doctor puts someone else’s in you, your body will reject it. But if the kidney was say... re-created from your stem cells so it carried your own DNA... Your body would instantly accept it.
(a beat)
It’s basically like Lucas’s DNA is part of the equation. The older me knew that temporal fracture wouldn’t collapse if Lucas re- entered it.
JESSIE
So, Lucas is like the only person who could have traveled back in time?
Exactly.
DANIEL
LUCAS
(frustrated)
So, why would you do the equation again, if you sent me back in time to STOP YOU from DOING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!?
DANIEL
Because, he... I didn’t realize that by sending you back here, I’d be punching you into a reality that you’re not supposed to be in!
(heavy)
Subsequently creating a...
LUCAS
(getting it)
A glitch in the Matrix.
DANIEL
JESSIE
(getting it)
A glitch in the Matrix.
Exactly.
(serious)
All this weird stuff started happening the moment you guys stopped me from doing the equation.
MADISON
(to Lucas)
That’s when you started feeling bad.
DANIEL
And it’s only gonna get worse. (to Lucas, dire)
Lucas, you’re not supposed to be here. And now, if I DON’T open that wormhole again at 12:12AM, you’ll be completely erased from reality.
LUCAS
So, I’m erased! (a beat)
If that’s what it’s gonna take to stop the War... That’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make.
DANIEL
Lucas, you’re not getting it. (deadly serious)
If you’re erased from this reality... That means you’ll be erased from existence itself.
(a beat)
Which means you were never born, your parents never met, their parents and so on...
(a beat)
(MORE)
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Which would cause a chain reaction that would destroy the entire universe as we know it.
There is a long silence as that sinks in.
LUCAS
Oh.
JESSIE
Yeah, that’s not good.
DANIEL
No, it’s not! Which is why I have to open that dimensional wormhole again tonight, so we can remove Lucas from this reality.
JESSIE
How exactly do we do that?
DANIEL
Well, when the wormhole opens... Lucas is gonna have to jump into it.
MADISON
And then what?
DANIEL
Well...
(pausing uncomfortably) I’m not exactly sure.
JESSIE
What do you mean you’re not exactly sure?
DANIEL
Hypothetically, he’d close the temporal fracture he entered causing a chain reaction that would revert everything back to zero.
A long beat passes.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Or... He’ll be sent into some alternate dimension.
MADISON
What?
LUCAS
(to himself. sarcastic) Well, this day just keeps getting better and better.
DANIEL
(to Lucas)
If it makes you feel any better, I’m pretty sure we’re screwed anyway.
Why?
JESSIE
DANIEL
Because The Mcauliffe Equation was an accident.
(bleak)
I DON’T KNOW WHAT I DID!
(a beat)
So, unless you can somehow erase the last few hours from my memory, I won’t make the same mistakes I did that caused it to happen in the first place and...
(finite)
Bye, bye universe.
LUCAS
(matter of fact)
I can erase your memory.
You can?
JESSIE
Yes.
LUCAS
Really?
DANIEL
(intense)
But what about the Klathorians? We can’t let those bastards enter our dimension when you open that wormhole again.
DANIEL
(in agreement)
Well, one of you will have to kill them when they come through.
(a beat)
You’ll just have to make sure you stay out of my way until it happens.
LUCAS
(with resolute intention) OK. So how do we do this?
INT. DANIEL’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Everything is cleaned up. Daniel sits at his desk, checking his watch. Lucas is adjusting a tiny SYRINGE-LIKE needle on his gauntlet.
DANIEL
(nervous) Will this hurt?
LUCAS
Not a bit.
DANIEL
Remember to stay out of my way until I do the experiment. No one can interact with me at all or this won’t work.
JESSIE
We understand.
DANIEL
(re: syringe. nervous) Will my memory ever come back?
LUCAS
MADISON
(loudly) QUAID!
Lucas and Daniel JUMP, startled!
(spooked)
LUCAS
(spooked)
DANIEL
AHHH!!!!
MADISON
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!
I.... You know, from the movie TOTAL RECALL?
Jessie CHUCKLES - she got it.
MADISON (CONT’D)
(apologetic)
Sorry... I was just trying to lighten the mood.
DANIEL
Well please don’t.
Madison SHRUGS apologetically and steps back. Lucas aims his syringe at Daniel’s neck.
LUCAS
Good luck.
DANIEL
You too.
Daniel takes a deep BREATH and Lucas SLAMS the needle into the base of his neck. He SLUMPS onto his desk.
EXT. DANIEL MCAULIFFE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Lucas, Madison and Jessie watch Daniel exit his house, get in his car and drive away.
MADISON
Now what?
JESSIE
We lay low at my house for the next hour then head to the lab.
INT. JESSIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Jessie leads Madison and Lucas into the house. She tosses her jacket on the table as Madison takes in the DEMOLISHED LIVING ROOM.
MADISON
What the hell happened in here?
JESSIE
First Lugorc attack. (sarcastic)
Or as I like to call it, a “glimpse” at what will most likely keep me grounded--
CAMILLE (O.C.)
--for the rest of your life!
Jessie shuts her eyes: fuck me. CAMILLE has landed at the bottom of the stairs.
CAMILLE (CONT’D)
You are so dead. When Dad sees this house...
(noticing Lucas and Madison)
Uh... Who are the two old people standing in our living room?
JESSIE
(panicked) Camille, listen...
CAMILLE
No, you listen to me you little...
THUNK, THUNK! Camille SPASMS then collapses to the floor with a THUD. Jessie turns to Lucas, who lowers his SMOKING rifle.
LUCAS
It took everything in me not to make those rounds lethal.
JESSIE
(relieved)
I might not have cared.
Jessie turns to Madison, as if nothing just happened.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
So, would you like to see the little guy who first discovered that Milk doesn’t do the body good?
MADISON
Uh... Sure.
Jessie STEPS OVER Camille’s unconscious body and MOTIONS for Madison to follow her into the kitchen.
INT. JESSIE'S KITCHEN
Jessie arrives at the kitchen doorway, FREEZES and nervously FARTS.
Lucas?
JESSIE
(grasping at hope)
Does this explain where that Lugorc from the bar came from?
Lucas STEPS behind Jessie and pales. We PAN DOWN to the pile of torn up membrane on the floor.
LUCAS
Oh, no...
Lucas nervously examines it.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Please, tell me I wasn’t that stupid.
He looks up at the trail of slime leading to the empty pantry
- and drops his head. He knows exactly what it means.
He turns to Jessie and gives her a painfully apologetic look. Jessie seems to understand what’s coming.
JESSIE
We have a really big problem don’t we?
Yup.
LUCAS
JESSIE
It’s gonna make the next hour and a half really difficult isn’t it?
LUCAS
(nods apologetically) It is.
JESSIE
Our chances of surviving it are slim.
LUCAS
(matter of fact) It’ll take a miracle.
Jessie NODS as if surrendering to the bad news to come.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(polite)
Do you mind calling Freddy for me?
JESSIE
(polite) Not at all.
Jessie pulls out her cell and begins to dial. Madison, having just witnessed this entire exchange, CHIMES in.
MADISON
(confused)
What is going on here?
LUCAS
(matter of fact)
Well, I’m calling Freddy right now to have him hack into the surveillance cameras at Westfield Laboratory, to see if it’s crawling with Lugorcs.
Jessie hands Lucas her cell phone.
JESSIE
It’s ringing.
LUCAS
Thank you.
Lucas lifts the phone to his ear.
MADISON
Why would it be crawling with Lugorcs?
LUCAS
Because, I’m pretty sure the Lugorc we killed in this kitchen was a female. It was the first time I experienced the deadly effects of Milk, so I foolishly failed to deliver a secondary shot to it’s lower pectoral region.
Jessie nods. All the information Lucas is delivering is news to her - but she acts as if she already knew all of it.
FREDDY (O.S.)
(on cellphone)
It’s Dustin. What cha need, Eleven?
LUCAS
(into cell) It’s me.
FREDDY (O.S.)
(on cellphone)
Oh, what’s going on Chief?
LUCAS
(into cell)
Do you mind hacking into the LIVE footage from the surveillance cameras at Mcauliffe’s lab for me, real quick?
FREDDY (O.S.)
(on cellphone)
Not at all. Give me a sec.
Lucas covers the mouthpiece and continues.
LUCAS
(to Madison)
We do that secondary shot to make sure that if the Lugorc is female, the fertilized egg it’s carrying is destroyed - so it can’t mature into an adult Alpha. A smart and very dangerous Alpha Lugorc, genetically programmed to carry out orders, who can do things --
FREDDY (O.S.)
(on cellphone, nervously) Chief, I think we might have a serious Demogorgon problem.
LUCAS
(conceding defeat)
-- like lay growth nests.
Lucas shoots Jessie an apologetic look.
JESSIE
(with a sarcastic smirk) Well, let’s get to it then, shall we.
FREDDY (O.S.)
(to Lucas)
I’ve counted 16 Lugorcs so far...
INT. FREDDY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
They all stand behind Freddy, staring uncomfortably at his computer screen.
FREDDY
Wait...
(pointing)
FREDDY’S COMPUTER SCREEN - is displaying multiple LIVE SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS featuring LUGORCS (of varying sizes) roaming the lad.
MADISON (O.C.)
(to Lucas, concerned) Your Alpha has been busy.
Lucas POINTS to a surveillance video showing A LARGE, SEMI- TRANSPARENT CRYSTALLITE DOME with DOZENS OF BABY LUGORCS
SQUIRMING AROUND inside it.
LUCAS
(weary but in control)
If we don’t destroy that other nest before it hatches, there’s gonna be an army of Lugorcs between us and Mcauliffe.
Jessie looks at her watch.
JESSIE
Who’s doing his equation in a little over an hour.
MADISON
So what’s the plan?
LUCAS
We’re gonna need explosives, weapons... And a shit-ton of Milk.
INT. RALPHS/HOME DEPO/WALMART - VARIOUS
MONTAGE: Lucas loads pipes, wires and cleaning supplies into a shopping cart / Freddy grabs Milk jugs from the refrigerator section / Madison loads up on boxes of batteries
/ Jessie grabs several SUPER-SOAKER water guns off a shelf.
INT. FREDDY'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
They DUMP the supplies onto the floor.
LUCAS
I’ll get to work on the explosives. (to Jessie and Madison)
You two are on weapons detail.
Freddy RAISES his hand.
FREDDY
What about me?
LUCAS
I need a detailed structural blueprint of Westford Laboratories.
INT. DANIEL MCAULIFFE'S SECRET OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Wearing his BEATS by Dre headphones - Daniel places the “Don’t forget to engage the quantum interface” Post-it on his hard drive then pulls up a PLAYLIST on his iPhone marked: “LEVEL UP” - and hits SHUFFLE.
INT. FREDDY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
The team is gathered behind Freddy, staring at his computer screen. Jessie and Madison have Milk filled water guns strapped across their shoulders, back-up MILK bottles hooked on their belts, skate pads the works.
LUCAS
(impressed)
I can’t believe you built that whole thing in 15 minutes.
INSERT COMPUTER SCREEN - Freddy has created a detailed version of Westford Laboratories in MINECRAFT.
JESSIE
I can’t believe you still use Minecraft.
LUCAS
OK, let’s go over this one more time.
(checking his watch)
We have 45 minutes ‘till Mcauliffe does his experiment.
(MORE)
LUCAS (CONT'D)
(re: Minecraft map)
The Lugorcs are primarily grouped outside the entrance to the labs. We need to eliminate and/or lure them away, so we can get in.
Freddy animates “Steve” in his Minecraft map, giving us a visual of what Lucas is explaining. He’s even created Lugorc Avatars.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Once Madison and I arrive by the north wing.
(to Jessie)
You and Freddy blow the other nest. That should allow us to force the remaining Lugorcs towards the commissary where we can hold them.
MADISON
And the Alpha?
LUCAS
Hopefully she’ll reveal herself in the chaos.
FREDDY
And because she carries the Klathorian’s adaptive DNA, she might look human?
LUCAS
(nodding)
So, if you bump into a naked version of yourself - shoot it.
JESSIE
And if all this doesn’t work?
Lucas looks at the charging panel on his armor which reads at 88%. He nods uncomfortably.
LUCAS
(unhappy about this) Bring some Ibuprofen... And pray we won’t need it.
Jessie nods with a SHRUG. Freddy RAISES his hand.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Freddy, you don’t have to raise your hand every time you have a question.
FREDDY
(lowering his hand)
I just wanted to ask how we plan to cover the access tunnel in the sub- level basement?
LUCAS
What sub-level basement?
Freddy animates “Steve” to a new section of the Minecraft map.
LUCAS (O.C.) (CONT’D)
That wasn’t on the surveillance cameras?
FREDDY
No cameras down there. I saw it on the blueprints.
LUCAS
AND YOU’RE TELLING ME THIS NOW!?
Freddy SHRUGS apologetically. Lucas stares at the computer.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(concerned)
We’re gonna need more people.
Jessie gives Lucas a BEMUSED GRIN.
JESSIE
Time to call in the Goonies?
Off Madison’s confused look we -
CUT TO:
INT. FREDDY’S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
Jessie addresses someone O.S.
JESSIE
You two need to be super cool, OK. This is real life stuff. We are legit trying to save the universe here.
REVERSE - CAMERON and PARKER stand across from Jessie trying to contain their excited faces. They’re both geared up like Jessie and Madison too.
Madison is helping Lucas secure the last of four, one gallon MILK JUGS - to the crude but powerful looking SHAPE CHARGER BOMB he’s been finishing.
MADISON
(under her breath)
Are you sure it’s a good idea to bring those two into this?
LUCAS
(matter-of-fact) Not at all.
JESSIE
(continuing)
You two are strictly back up, OK? God willing you‘ll just be standing around for half an hour doing nothing. Which I know you both excel at.
LUCAS
(continuing to work)
But just to be on the safe side... you’ll both have one of these pipe bombs.
He motions to the handmade PIPE BOMBS resting beside his Shape Charger. Each one has a 1 gallon milk jug wired to it.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Hopefully you won’t need to use them, but if you do, the blast radius will cover about a 20 feet so... The more Lugorcs around you the better.
He DUSTS OFF HIS HANDS and STANDS UP.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Everyone clear on the plan?
They nod. Lucas looks around.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Where the hell is Freddy? A VOICE comes from the bathroom O.S.
FREDDY (O.S.)
I’m almost ready!
Parker has picked up one of the pipe bombs and is playing with it.
LUCAS
Parker, if you could try not to kill us all before we leave, that would be great.
Goals.
PARKER
She gives Lucas a thumbs up, DROPPING the pipe bomb. They collectively GASP as it HITS the floor. Luckily it doesn’t blow. She SMIRKS.
PARKER (CONT’D)
(apologetically) My bad.
As if ON CUE, Freddy EMERGES from the bathroom, having taken “gearing up” to the next level. He’s covered from head-to-toe in air-soft camouflage gear and has even PAINTED HIS FACE. He LIFTS his Super Soaker.
FREDDY
(pumped) Let’s do this.
Lucas and Jessie exchange a pained look.
JESSIE
(sardonic levity) We’re all gonna die.
LUCAS
(nodding in agreement)
The chances of this working are very slim.
JESSIE
At least we’ll go down together --
LUCAS
(nodding)
-- and take the entire universe with us.
They share a smile. Jessie raises her water gun.
JESSIE
Well, what do you say we go hero the shit out of this!
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - OUTER HALLWAY 1
Wearing bandanas to shield themselves from the smell, Lucas and Jessie carefully place the Shape Charge Bomb by the unopened Lugorc nest.
EXT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - BACK LOADING DOCK - MOMENTS LATER
They quietly exit the lab UNFOLDING A LONG DETONATOR CORD until they arrive beside Madison and Freddy - a few feet away. Lucas carefully ATTACHES the cord to a REMOTE DETONATOR which he hands to Jessie.
LUCAS
OK. We’re hot.
He TAPS his throat mic (note: only Lucas, Jessie and Cameron have throat mics).
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(into mic)
Cam, how’s everything looking down there?
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - SUB LEVEL TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
Parker and Cameron stand with their water guns at the ready. A large puddle of Milk has been POURED ACROSS THE FLOOR behind them, SEPARATING THEM from the dark inner hallway.
CAMERON
We’re ready to go.
PARKER
Goals.
EXT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - CONTINUOUS
LUCAS
(to Jessie)
Once Madison and I reach the north corridor, I’ll signal you to blow the nest.
Jessie nods, looking a little scared.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
You, OK?
JESSIE
(lying) 100%.
LUCAS
(being positive)
I’ll see you on the other side.
INT. WESTFORD LABS - MAIN CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
Lucas and Madison stand on either side of the pitch dark corridor. We can hear Lugorcs GURGLE and SNARL in the darkness. Lucas RAISES his rifle.
LUCAS
Just stay close to me.
She LIFTS her milk-filled water gun with a confident smile.
MADISON
Try not to fall behind.
Lucas SMILES - and they CHARGE into the darkness!
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - EAST SUB LEVEL - CONTINUOUS
We are looking at Parker via her SNAPCHAT STORY she’s recording. She makes a “peace sign” and angles the camera at Cameron.
CAMERON
Parker, Lucas told us not to post anything on social media...
(his face SOURS) OMG...
(into camera) Girlfriend, just ripped the nastiest fart.
INT. WESTFORD LABS - MAIN CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
Lucas and Madison EMERGE from the corridor, covered in chunks of Lugorc meat. Lucas stares at Madison, impressed.
LUCAS
Do you teach Tactical Assault drills on weekends, too?
MADISON
Maybe.
Lucas TAPS his throat mic.
LUCAS
(into mic) Jessie, blow the nest!
There’s no response. He TAPS the mic again.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Jessie?
(SMACKING his mic, concerned)
Come on. Not now.
EXT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - CONTINUOUS
Jessie stands beside Freddy, impatient.
JESSIE
What’s Lucas waiting for? That nest is gonna....
A LOUD CRACK rings out O.S.
FREDDY
(pan-iced)
Was that what I think it was?
Freddy nervously STEPS BACK - accidentally TEARING THE CORD OUT of the remote detonator.
JESSIE
(pissed) Freddy, you idiot!!!
A GURGLING ROAR rings out O.S.
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - LOWER SUB-LEVEL
Lucas and Madison look up as the sound ECHOES past them. They exchange a look: they know exactly what that means.
MADISON
(worried) Oh God.
A BOOM suddenly RINGS OUT from the opposite direction.
LUCAS
That came from the sub-level.
They exchange a concerned look.
MADISON
Get to Jessie. I’ll go after Cam and Parker.
Lucas NODS and they TAKE OFF in opposite directions!
EXT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - CONTINUOUS
Jessie frantically tries to re-attach the detonator cord. Several more ROARS ring out O.S.
FREDDY
(terrified) The nest is open!
JESSIE
I’m aware of that Freddy!
FREDDY
What are we gonna do?
Jessie looks around trying to think. She spots a metal staircase leading up to the second floor.
JESSIE
(taking charge)
We’ll just go over them. Find Lucas on the other side.
She LIFTS her water gun and makes for the stairs.
FREDDY
Buuu... I... Wwww...
Jessie turns back to see Freddy has stopped moving. His eyes are frozen like a deer in headlights.
JESSIE
Freddy? No, no, no...
She runs back and WAVES HER HAND across his face - he’s totally unresponsive.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Come on... We don’t have time for this, Freddy!
(loosing it)
PULL IT TOGETHER BURNS!
She SLAPS Freddy across the face - stunning him back into his body. He BLINKS in pain.
FREDDY
Ouch.
JESSIE
(a leader emerging)
Freddy, are the air-soft games you play with your little sister all you’re capable of? Or will there be a monument built in your honor someday, that says Freddy Rambo?
A steely wave of prepubescent masculinity WASHES OVER FREDDY’S FACE. He take a DEEP BREATH and LIFTS his water gun with purpose.
FREDDY
(confidence) Rambo.
JESSIE
Alright. Then let’s go make sure we’ll have a world to put it in.
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - SUB-LEVEL TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
Madison RACES down the dark tunnel. The sound of CARNAGE is coming from the darkness.
MADISON CAM! PARKER!
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Jessie enters the upper level doorway with Freddy. She shoots MILK around the frame as Freddy scans the hallway like he’s some kind of trained Navy Seal now. He PRESSES an imaginary throat mic.
FREDDY
All clear.
(to Jessie)
I’ll seal the door at the west corner, then double back and meet you by the main conference room.
JESSIE
You know you’re not wearing a throat mic, right?
Freddy NODS and TAPS his “imaginary” mic again.
FREDDY
Moving out.
Jessie watches him disappear down the hall and shakes her head.
JESSIE
We’re definitely gonna die.
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Freddy SEALS a different doorway with his water gun.
FREDDY
West entrance secured. (tapping his imaginary mic)
Engaging night-vision.
Freddy turns on the FLASHLIGHT taped to his water gun - ILLUMINATING the face of an INFANT SIZED LUGORC standing across from him. Despite the slime DRIPPING from its talon spiked appendages, it looks surprisingly innocent.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
Awww... Aren’t you cute.
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - SUB-LEVEL TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
Madison SKIDS to a stop as she comes upon Cameron and Parker - who are using their water-guns to SHOOT DOWN Lugorcs on the other side of their milk line with calm efficiency.
Cameron looks over at Madison with a smile.
CAMERON
(casual) What’s up, Mrs. Wu!
MADISON
You guys are OK?
Parker looks over her shoulder at Madison as she continues to FIRE.
Goals.
PARKER
EXT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Jessie arrives by the doors to the conference room and looks around.
JESSIE
(a loud whisper) Freddy? Are you here?
She hears FOOTSTEPS approaching O.S. She RAISES her water gun as Freddy EMERGES from the dark hallway - with the infant Lugorc on his shoulder, BITING HIS NECK!
FREDDY
(total panic)
GET IT OFF!!! GET IT OFF!!!
Jessie calmly SHOOTS the infant off his neck as he RUNS by. Despite being free from his attacker, Freddy continues RUNNING - and disappears down the hall.
JESSIE (CALLING AFTER HIM)
FREDDY! I GOT IT!
Freddy re-emerges RUNNING back towards Jessie - with a SWARM of BABY LUGORCS ON HIS TAIL.
Jessie backpedals, PULLING the PIPE BOMB from her hip. Holding her water gun in ONE HAND, she PICKS OFF several Lugorcs and LIGHTS her bomb with the other. It’s an impressive feat by any standard.
She tosses the pipe bomb at the swarm: BOOM! The explosion LAUNCHES THEM against the wall.
They sit up, trying to get their bearings when a much larger Lugorc LEAPS though the smoke DESCENDING on them!
JESSIE (CONT'D) AHHH!!!!
AHHH!!!
FREDDY
They DUCK, just missing the Lugorc’s talon which SINKS into the wall above their heads! They ROLL under the creature’s body to get away. With its free arm, it manages to KNOCK Jessie’s water gun from her hand and send it SPINNING down the hallway.
As the Lugorc struggles to FREE its TALON from the wall - Jessie and Freddy scramble to their feet and RACE for the conference room!
INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
They BOUND into the room and lock the door behind them. They RUN across the room as the Lugorc SLAMS its body against the door.
Jessie and Freddy reach the corner just before the Lugorc BURSTS through the door!
They have no place to go. Jessie SCREAMS at Freddy as the Lugorc CHARGES!
JESSIE SHOOT IT!!!
Freddy FIRES his water gun INTO THE BEASTS FACE just before it reaches them. It stops - momentarily blinded - but doesn’t start to melt.
Jessie stares at Freddy’s water gun, WIPES a drop of milk off it’s barrel and TASTES it.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(incredulously) Is that soy milk?
Freddy SHRUGS innocently.
FREDDY
I’m lactose intolerant.
Jessie shuts her eyes as the Lugorc REARS BACK to strike when
- BLAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT - bullets BURSTS UP THROUGH THE FLOOR,
cutting a perfect circle around them. They exchange a look as floor beneath them CRACKS - and they DROP DOWN through it!
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - LOWER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Jess and Freddy LAND on the ground beside LUCAS, still standing on the circular piece of floor he just shot out with his rifle.
LUCAS
You guys OK?
They NOD in shock as Lucas LIGHTS his pipe bomb.
FREDDY
The Lugorc nest opened.
LUCAS
I’m aware of that, Freddy.
He PITCHES the bomb up through the fresh hole in the ceiling.
JESSIE
I thought you were gonna signal me to set off the bomb.
BOOM! Lugorc bits SPLATTER across them.
LUCAS
I tried.
(pointing to his throat mic)
It wouldn’t work.
FREDDY
What? I just bought those.
Annoyed, Freddy begins to examine Lucas’s mic pack. Jessie CHECKS HER WATCH. We can hear Lugorcs approaching O.S.
JESSIE
(to Lucas, concerned) We’re running out of time.
LUCAS
(nodding) I know.
Freddy casually FLIPS something on Lucas’s mic pack and it CRACKLES to life.
FREDDY
Power was off.
Madison’s VOICE comes over his radio.
MADISON (O.S.)
LUCAS!?
LUCAS
(taps his Mic) Yeah, Maddy. It’s me.
MADISON (O.S.)
(relieved) Thank God.
LUCAS
(into mic) Is everyone OK?
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - SUB-LEVEL TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
Madison is HOLDING a throat mic to her neck. Parker and Cameron continue to FIRE their water guns O.S.
MADISON
Not really... There must have been another growth nest down here because we’re facing a lot of Lugorcs.
(starts firing her water gun)
We’re holding them back, but we’re gonna run out of milk soon.
(a beat)
Please, tell me you got a plan?
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - LOWER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Lucas CHECKS the charging bar on his armor: IT’S AT 98%. He looks around trying to think when his gaze falls upon the LARGE COMMISSARY across the hall from them.
LUCAS
Jessie, you brought that Ibuprofen?
She nods, pulling a single use PACKET OF ADVIL out from her pocket. Lucas EXHALES uncomfortably.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(into mic)
Madison, how many shape charge grenades do you have left?
MADISON (O.S.)
Parker has one.
FREDDY
I have mine too.
LUCAS
OK.
(into mic)
(MORE)
LUCAS (CONT'D)
Do you think you can force those Lugorcs into the south corridor with two of them?
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - SUB-LEVEL TUNNEL
Madison TILTS her head, confused.
MADISON
(confused)
Yeah, but... Won’t that send them all straight to you?
LUCAS (O.S.)
Yes.
INTERCUT FOR CONVERSATION
MADISON
(concerned)
Lucas, I don’t understand? Why would you want me to do that?
LUCAS
I don’t have time to explain. As soon as your clear, get to Mcauliffe’s lab.
(a beat)
I need you to be there when the wormhole opens to kill those Klathorians, if I’m late.
MADISON
(confused) Late?
LUCAS
Just trust me, Maddy. I got a plan.
MADISON
OK.
LUCAS
I’m sending Freddy, now.
Lucas turns to Freddy, whose just standing there.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Why are you just standing there? GO!!!
Freddy TAKES OFF. Lucas PULLS out one of his KATANA BLADES -
and SLICES open his hand.
JESSIE
What are you doing?
LUCAS
Laying bait.
His BLOOD starts to DRIP onto the floor.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
My blood is what triggered that first Lugorc and the Alpha inside it, to grow.
Lucas continues as they RUN towards the commissary.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
So, it’s inside every Lugorc that hatched from those nests.
INT. WESTFORD LABS - VARIOUS
LUCAS (O.S.)
(continuing)
Their primal instinct to track it will override anything else...
The Lugorcs begin to PACE in a wild frenzy as they SMELL LUCAS’S BLOOD.
INT. COMMISSARY - CONTINUOUS
Lucas and Jessie enter the huge commissary. They RUN toward the center of the room. Lucas is leaving a trail of blood behind him.
LUCAS
(continuing)
...and I need them all close, for this to work.
INT. WESTFORD LABORATORIES - SUB-LEVEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
BOOM! Madison LIGHTS the first pipe bomb, pushing the HORD of Lugorcs back.
INT. COMMISSARY - CONTINUOUS
A second BOOM rings out O.S. Madison’s VOICE comes over Lucas’s radio.
MADISON (O.S.)
They’re on their way.
LUCAS
(into mic) I’ll see you soon.
Lucas ties off the cut on his hand and checks his armor.
INSERT CHARGING BAR: It reads 99%.
He POINTS to a steel serving island in the corner.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(to Jessie)
When all the Lugorcs are inside get under that island. The thick steel on it will protect you when it starts.
JESSIE
When what starts?
Def Leppard’s “Pour Some Sugar On Me” begins to play O.S. Lucas YELPS in pain - and drops to his knee.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(concerned) Lucas?
Suddenly his head begins to SHAKE and WARP like a blur. It lasts for a few seconds then stops. He wobbles, dizzy.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Are you OK?
LUCAS
That did NOT feel good.
We hear the SONG playing O.S. again. Lucas’s body WARPS and FLICKERS for a moment again.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
AHHH!!!
(re: the music)
I think Mcauliffe started. (his legs give out)
Quick, get us over to the island.
Jessie helps Lucas over to the serving island.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Madison, Freddy, Cameron and Parker RACE down the hallway towards Daniel’s Secret Lab!
INT. COMMISSARY - CONTINUOUS
Lucas BRACES himself AGAINST THE ISLAND, as his body WARPS again.
LUCAS
I’m sorry Jessie... your gonna have to do it.
JESSIE
Do what?
LUCAS
Put on my armor.
JESSIE
What?
Jessie’s face LIGHTS UP. This is literally the moment she's been waiting for.
I...
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Her words fail. Inches from her dream, the subconscious voice that’s been telling her that she’s “not good enough”, rears it ugly head.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(hesitant)
I... don’t think that’s a good idea.
LUCAS
What? Jess, this isn’t so much an idea as a necessity.
JESSIE
You’re the hero here, Lucas. Not me.
LUCAS
What are you talking about?
Jessie doesn’t respond. Lucas suddenly seems to understand what’s going on and softens.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(matter-of-fact)
Jessie, you’re the reason I’m alive.
(emotional)
I’ve been fighting in this war since I was 14. I’ve wanted to give up and quit more times than I can remember. The only reason I didn’t, is because of you...
She wasn’t expecting that.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
...I’d say to myself “What would Jessie do, right now?” And every single time, I’d hear you say, “Just keep going, Lucas.”
Jessie tears up a little.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Jessie, you’re more of a hero than I’ll ever be.
(a beat)
You were born to wear this armor.
JESSIE
(fighting the fear)
I...
(re: his armor)
I don’t even know how to use it?
LUCAS
Yes you do.
(a beat)
It’s not the technology in the armor that makes it work... It’s the person whose driving it.
A tear rolls down Jessie’s cheek a she NODS. Lucas opens his hand and Jessie places a PACKET OF ADVIL in it. He MOTIONS to a small sensor on his wrist.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Place your finger there.
Jessie PUTS HER FINGER on the sensor. It scans it and DINGS!
ARMOR AI (O.S.)
NEW DRIVER BIO-SIGNATURE ACCEPTED.
PING, PING, PING, Lucas’s armor POPS open in the back. Jessie helps Lucas out of the armor - which remains upright.
LUCAS
Just step into my boots.
Jessie NODS and STEPS into his HUGE boots. The CHARGING BAR flips to 100%.
ARMOR AI (O.S.) INITIATING TACTICAL RE-SIZING.
The armor HUMS, SURGING WITH POWER! It RECONFIGURES itself to FIT Jessie’s frame. BEEP!
ARMOR AI (O.S.) (CONT’D) RE-SIZING COMPLETE.
Jessie can barley contain herself as she takes in the bad-ass armored suit she’s FINALLY WEARING.
JESSIE
I’m pretty sure I just shit in my pants a little bit again.
Lucas SMILES as Lugorcs ROAR O.S.
LUCAS
Go hero the shit out of this.
Jessie NODS brimming with a confidence as the first Lugorc
BOUNDS into the commissary.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(pointing)
Get in the center of the room.
Jessie nods and TAKES OFF as all the Lugorcs begin to STREAM IN. She ARRIVES in the center of the room.
JESSIE
(yelling) NOW WHAT?
LUCAS
(yelling back)
OPEN THE PROTECTIVE PLATE TO THE RED BUTTON AND REST YOUR FINGER ON IT!
She does exactly what he says.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
WHEN THE LUGORCS ARE CLOSE, TAKE A DEEP BREATH...
(somewhat apologetic)
...AND PRESS IT.
She NODS as the Lugorcs circle in around her, HISSING and SNARLING.
NOW?
JESSIE
(yelling)
LUCAS
(yelling)
NO! WAIT ‘TILL THEY’RE A LITTLE CLOSER!
Jessie NODS, letting the LUGORCS close in. She’s surprisingly poised considering the danger she’s face-to-face with.
The closest Lugorc LIFTS its arm. The moment it POPS out it TALONS to strike - Lucas SCREAMS!
LUCAS (CONT’D)
NOW!
TIGHT ON JESSIE - She PRESSES the red button and her armor COMES TO LIFE! A helmet quickly folds out over her head.
Two stabilizing bars SPRING from her back, BOLTING themselves into the floor! With AMAZING SPEED the armor CLICKS, SHIFTS, and LOCKS over Jessie, transforming into a large, ARMORED BALL - and begins SPINNING 360 degrees between the stabilizing bars as dozens of tiny GUN BARRELS pop out all over it.
Lucas DUCKS his head beneath the island.
BLAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! A HAILSTORM of LASER FIRE shoots out
from the ball SHREDDING THE LUGORCS - and everything else in the room - to BITS!
After a few seconds of PURE MAYHEM - the BALL stops SPINNING and begins TRANSFORMING back to normal.
Lucas CRAWLS OUT from under the island and STUMBLES OVER to Jessie. He arrives just as her helmet FOLDS BACK - revealing her blood-shot eyes and pale face. He TEARS the single use ADVIL packet OPEN - and dumps two pills into her hand.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(weakly) Sorry.
Jessie glances at the pills and NODS painfully.
JESSIE
(pride) Worth it.
She TOSSES the pills in her mouth and THROWS Lucas’s arm over her shoulder.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Come on.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Jessie and Lucas CALL OUT for the others as they approach the Xerox room.
MADISON!
LUCAS
FREDD...
JESSIE
They come upon Madison, Freddy, Cameron and Parker - standing outside the Xerox room - like lifeless zombies.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
What the...
Lucas THROWS HIS HAND over Jessie’s mouth and POINTS to Madison. A creepy, multi-tentacle worm is PULSATING on her neck. The others have them too.
LUCAS
(under his breath)
Grim worm. Neuron inhibiting parasite.
JESSIE
(under her breath) And Alpha’s make those?
Lucas NODS when SOMETHING HITS HIM. He SLAMS against the wall. Jessie GULPS and turns to THE ALPHA. It looks almost identical to LUCAS - except completely naked. Jessie looks away, disturbed.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
I did not need to see that.
THE ALPHA ROARS. Like Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Arc - Jessie casually lifts the rifle and SHOOTS the Alpha in the chest. It SLAMS on the ground with a THUD. Jessie RACES to Lucas and helps him up.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
You OK?
LUCAS
(struggling to breathe) She’s really strong.
JESSIE
(matter-of-fact) Female.
Lucas NODS and points to Mcauliffe - who they can see getting up from his desk across the Xerox room.
LUCAS
You need to get into the lab and kill the Klathorians when he opens that wormhole.
(off her concerned look) I’ll be right behind you.
She NODS and GETS UP at the exact same moment the ALPHA DOES.
It’s barely winded by the rounds she pumped into her chest.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
(to Jessie, SCREAMING) RUN!!!!
Jessie stares the Alpha down and SHAKES her head. Lucas looks at her, like she’s crazy.
LUCAS (CONT’D)
Jessie?
She TOSSES him his rifle.
JESSIE
Take care of those Klathorians. (a beat)
I’ve got this biatch.
INT. DANIEL’S SECRET PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS
Identical to the open - Daniel DANCES down the passageway. As he pulls the CAPTAIN AMERICA action figure from his pocket - Jessie EXPLODES THROUGH THE WALL behind him, trading BLOWS with the Alpha - clearly NOT having this BIATCH.
Daniel can’t hear a thing over the Def Leppard BLASTING through his headphones.
DANIEL
(to action figure)
You ready to make history CaAAAAAA -
As he VANISHES below to the “Watch the first step!” note, Lucas STAGGERS into the passageway with his rifle.
INT. DANIEL’S SECRET LAB - CONTINUOUS
Daniel PLACES the action figure on the tower.
DANIEL
(singing)
“Pour some sugar on me. Oh, In the name of love  ”
As he dances to his WORK STATION - Lucas BURSTS through the doorway with his rifle. Three talons FLY OUT the passageway. THUNK, THUNK, THUNK, they pin Lucas to the door causing him to DROP HIS RIFLE! It SLIDES across the floor out of reach.
DANIEL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
Time to save the world Steve.
Daniel MISSES his chair, tumbles backwards and KICKS the bottom of his desk. As the pens LAUNCH into the air - A banged up Jessie comes through the door Lucas is PINNED too. Lucas MOTIONS to his rifle a few feet away as lights BURST and power cables BOUNCE with energy around them.
LUCAS GET THE RIFLE!
The WIND begins to swirl like a TORNADO. Jessie makes a DASH for the rifle - when The Alpha BURSTS into the lab. It tackles Jessie to the floor as the WORMHOLE OPENS with a THUNDERING CRACK!
Jessie trades BLOWS with The Alpha as an inhuman ROAR rings out O.S.
DANIEL (O.C.) Oh... My... God.
Jessie looks up to see several KLATHORIANS (large ant-like humanoids) step out of the SWIRLING DIMENSIONAL GATEWAY. The Alpha makes a quick move and LOCKS Jessie in a choke hold.
She reaches for the rifle - but it’s just out of reach.
She locks eyes with Lucas, helpless - there is nothing they can do now.
TIGHT ON DANIEL - He stares terrified at the Klathorians, then COCKS his head quizzically.
DANIEL’S POV: Just beyond the wormhole, a LARGE NOTE is attached to the wall that reads: LOOK DOWN.
Daniel LOOKS DOWN at his desk. Another note is STICKING OUT from the underside that reads: PULL HERE.
Daniel pulls - and THE PISTOL Lucas gave him earlier slides into view. A note is taped to it that reads: PICK UP! SHOOT MONSTERS!
Daniel awkwardly PICKS up the pistol, AIMS it at the Klathorians and FIRES! BLAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! The Klathorians are BLASTED OFF THEIR FEET backwards into the wormhole!
The Alpha that was pinning Jessie suddenly VANISHES. The TALONS pinning Lucas to the door VANISH TOO and he drops to the floor. They exchanges a look of utter astonishment.
They RUN over to Daniel. He SPINS to them with the pistol -
Jessie RIPS it from his hand before he shoots them.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Who are..
Before he can finish, Lucas PRESSES a button on Jessie’s armor - POPPING out a GLOWING needle - which she injects into his neck. Daniel BLINKS recognizing Lucas and Jessie again.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
Hey guys.
He looks at the wormhole, SWIRLING OPEN across the room and all his notes.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
I totally forgot about that. (explaining)
When you guys first left, I got paranoid I’d forget everything you said and... Left myself some notes.
LUCAS
I love your ADD Daniel.
Madison, Freddy, Cameron and Parker enter the lab. Madison RUNS over to them.
MADISON
What happened?
JESSIE
Daniel saved the day.
The ARMOR Jessie was wearing FADES AWAY.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(bummed) Damn it.
The entire room BEGINS TO SHAKE! Lucas let’s out a GRUNT and grabs onto the desk. His ENTIRE BODY begins PHASING IN-AND- OUT with intensity.
DANIEL
(remembering)
Our reality’s starting to collapse. (to Lucas)
You need to get into that wormhole, now.
Lucas NODS and Jessie and Madison help Lucas toward the SWIRLING WORMHOLE. The walls in the lab are beginning to FRACTURE and WARP!
LUCAS
(to Jessie)
If everything doesn’t revert back to zero when I jump into that thing... Remember not to tell anyone the truth about what happened here.
JESSIE
I won’t.
LUCAS
(he hesitates)
Except my Mom... Tell her the truth. She’ll be able to handle it.
JESSIE
OK.
They reach the wormhole’s EVENT HORIZON. Lucas looks a little nervous.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
You’re gonna be OK. (a beat)
(MORE)
JESSIE (CONT’D)
And if you’re about to jump into some alternate dimension... I won’t stop till, I find you.
MADISON
Me either.
Lucas SMILES as his body FAZES in and out.
LUCAS
I know.
(to Jessie, emotional) Jessie, the last time I left, I said I wanted more...
(a beat)
I don’t. You’re all the best friend I’ll ever need... and you always will be.
(a beat)
I love you Jessie.
Jessie smirks like Han Solo from The Empire Strikes Back.
JESSIE
I know.
They hug. When they separate Madison PLANTS A KISS on Lucas’s lips.
LUCAS
What was that for?
MADISON
Luck.
He SMILES. The whole room is SHAKING WITH FURY!
DANIEL (O.C.) YOU’VE GOT TO JUMP NOW, LUCAS!
Jessie gives Lucas one last look as everything in the lab WARPS and BENDS.
JESSIE
See you soon.
He nods and LEAPS INTO THE WORMHOLE! It collapses behind him with a EXPLOSIVE SNAP - and the entire lab returns to normal. Daniel BLINKS. He and the others look around as if to make sure what he’s seeing is real.
DANEIL
Holy crap... It worked. (exuberant)
IT ACTUALLY WORKED!
He triumphantly THROWS his FIST IN THE AIR! Jessie shoots him and incredulous look.
JESSIE
(irked)
Worked? You also said that when Lucas entered that wormhole everything might revert back to zero.
(looking around)
Does this feel like zero to you?
DANIEL
No.
JESSIE
Which means, my best friend just leaped into some alternate dimension didn’t he?
DANEIL
Yes.
JESSIE
So, until we figure out where he went and how to get him back.
(firm)
I believe you have some work to do?
He NODS. Jessie turns to Freddy and the others.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
Are you guys, OK?
CAMERON
That was so lit!
FREDDY
Goals.
PARKER
So... What happens now?
JESSIE
We get our stories straight. Lucas said no one can ever know the truth about what happened so that’s exactly what we’re gonna do.
(firm)
This stays between us. Got it.
They NOD in agreement.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
We’ll get together later to hash out the details. In the meantime, you all need to get home so we don’t have parents calling the cops about missing kids.
Jessie turns to Madison.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
You mind helping me drop these ladies home Toretto?
EXT. FREDDY’S HOUSE - LATER
Freddy stands on his doorstep, having just been dropped off. Jessie MOTIONS to her lips.
JESSIE
Keep it zipped, Freddy.
FREDDY
I will.
JESSIE
I’ll see you later.
Jessie WALKS back to Madison’s car.
FREDDY (O.C.)
Hey Jessie! She stops and turns.
FREDDY (CONT’D)
This was the single greatest night of my entire life.
(sincere)
Thanks for including me.
JESSIE
Trust me, if I had an option B, I would have taken it.
Jessie hops in the passenger seat then CALLS out the window to Freddy.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(with a smirk) And you’re welcome.
Freddy smiles.
MADISON
So, we head to Lucas’s mom’s house now?
JESSIE
Just have to grab something from my house first.
INT. JESSIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jessie enters and runs over to her jacket, sitting on the dinning room table. She DIGS inside the pocket and PULLS OUT the POLAROID Madison took of her and Lucas.
She turns to leave. Camille is standing in front of the door.
CAMILLE
Where do you think your going?
Jessie EXHALES, this is the last thing she needs.
CAMILLE (CONT’D)
I... I honestly don’t even know where to start?
Jessie stares at her for a long beat.
JESSIE
Well, if I were you, I’d start in the kitchen and then work my way forward. The banister is gonna take the most time and you only have 16 hours ‘till Dad comes home.
CAMILLE
What are you talking about?
JESSIE
Cleaning up after the rager of a party you threw here last night.
CAMILLE
What? This is your mess!
JESSIE
How could it be? I’ve been gone all night.
CAMILLE
So have I, turd-face.
JESSIE
Not according to LIFE360. Remember when you blackmailed me earlier and told to make sure your cellphone stayed charged in your room, so Dad would think you were home all weekend so you could go party with your friends?
CAMILLE
I... I don’t even know what you think you’re trying to pull here?... But it’s not gonna work. Dad won’t believe you.
JESSIE
Really? I’m 14 and your about to graduate from high school.
CAMILLE
You wouldn’t.
JESSIE
I just did.
Camille looks around, taking in the massive task ahead.
CAMILLE
How am I supposed to fix the banister?
JESSIE
You’ve learned everything in your life so far from YouTube. Look it up.
Jessie SMIRKS and WALKS out the door.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
(over her shoulder) Best sister ever.
EXT. LUCAS’S HOUSE - MADISON’S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
Jessie and Madison sit in her car outside Lucas’s house.
MADISON
You sure you don’t want me to come with you? Some things are easier to digest when they come from another adult.
JESSIE
No. I need to tell Abby this myself. It’s OK.
(a beat) She’ll believe me.
Jessie LIFTS the Polaroid and gazes at it for a moment.
MADISON
(tender)
We’ll find him, Jessie. I’m sure wherever Lucas is... He’s OK.
JESSIE
(confident) I know he is.
Madison looks at Lucas in the Polaroid.
MADISON
I already miss him.
Jessie restrains herself from reacting.
MADISON (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. Me having feelings for Lucas must be so weird for you.
JESSIE
It’s not that weird. (looking at the picture)
There’s a lot to love.
That’s the closest Madison may ever get to her blessing. Jessie HOPS out of the car.
JESSIE (CONT’D)
‘Night Madison.
MADISON
See you tomorrow. (re: Lucas’s mom)
Good luck in there.
JESSIE
Thanks.
Jessie watches Madison DRIVE OFF then turns to Lucas’s house. She takes a DEEP BREATH, grips the polaroid tightly in her hand and begins to walk toward the door.
DANIEL (O.C.)
Jessie!
She SPINS to see Daniel - RACING up the sidewalk towards her. He’s wearing protective goggles and carrying several pieces of futuristic looking gear.
JESSIE
Daniel? What are...
DANIEL
I was totally wrong. There’s no time to explain right now. The temporal window will only be open for a few seconds. Put these on!
He TOSSES Jessie a pair of SKYDIVING GOGGLES.
DANIEL (CONT’D)
I hope you’re not afraid of heights?
A DIMENSIONAL WORMHOLE OPENS UP as Daniel reaches her. He YANKS her into it with him. The wormhole COLLAPSES behind them with a BOOM!
We see the polaroid Jessie was holding, DRIFT OUT OF THE AIR and LAND on the sidewalk.
EXT. SKY - STORM CLOUDS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Daniel and Jessie MATERIALIZE out of a HOLE IN THE SKY - and PLUMMET toward a lightning storm below them. Just before they reach it, something SWOOPS by and WHISKS THEM AWAY!
EXT. HAZARD SKY SHIP - UPPER DECK - NIGHT
Jessie and Daniel TUMBLE to a stop in a large safety net on the stern of some kind of STEAMPUNK-LOOKING FLYING BOAT!
Daniel enthusiastically THROWS his fist INTO THE AIR!
DANIEL
IT WORKED!
JESSIE
What in the....
LUCAS (O.C.) DON’T START CELEBRATING YET!
Jessie looks over to see LUCAS - gripping the wheel of the ship as WIND whips through the blue and red mohawk that adorns his head. A decorative tattoo runs down the side of his face now too.
Lucas?
JESSIE
LUCAS
(over the wind)
GOOD TOO SEE YOU AGAIN, JESSIE! HOLD ON TIGHT. WE ONLY GOT ONE SHOT AT THIS!
Lucas CRANKS the wheel - and the ship BANKS DOWN into the storm clouds.
TIGHT ON JESSIE - Her cheeks begin to RIPPLE from the g-force of the ship’s dive. Her eyes go wide with horrified excitement as a LIGHTNING BOLT STRIKES O.S.
JESSIE
HOLY...
TO BE CONTINUED...
FADE TO BLACK.
(Over the end credits, similar to what Peter Parker did in the beginning of “Spider-Man: Homecoming”, we’ll watch Jessie’s very funny INSTAGRAM STORY. One she secretly recorded all day of Lucas and hers adventure.)
