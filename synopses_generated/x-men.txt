In present day, a GERMAN SOLDIER (30s) forcefully unloads frightened prisoners from a cattle car into a camp, revealing the harsh reality they're about to face. Among the chaos, a child is separated from his parents and a PRETTY GIRL OF 12 (12) faces the cruelty of other children in a devastated village. Meanwhile, in the city, a fierce confrontation unfolds in a high school gymnasium as Lloyd Dobler (18) stands up to Diane Court's father, signaling a young man's determination to fight for what he believes in. At the same time, an ominous transformation occurs when SCOTT SUMMERS' eyes reveal a fiery red, a hint of the powers awakening within him, which leads to a chaotic outburst as he flees the gym's bathroom. Elsewhere, in a snow-covered wilderness, JACK (35) and SARAH (33) argue in a cabin, while inside, a ferocious battle ensues as Logan is attacked by a large assailant.

The second act intensifies as Logan (40s) finds himself hunted and overwhelmed, falling through ice and struggling to survive against mutant adversaries. In the background, unrest grows in the world with tension mounting around the mutant issue, as senators focus on a domestic crisis. MAGNETO (45) manipulates metal at will, revealing his grand plans as he confronts Senator KELLY and X-Men try to stymie his efforts. Amidst the turmoil, private struggles continue as Logan breaks free from a lab's confines only to find himself lost within a maze of hallways, rejected offers of help, and the allure of freedom. Unbeknownst to him, ROGUE (25) infiltrates the mansion during the night, seeking her own solace in a place filled with uncertainty. However, Logan's troubled past comes rushing back when a military lab's excruciating experiment is revealed through a flashback. Not only Logan, but Jean and Cyclops, as well as young Rogue, must confront their inner demons and the enlarging threat posed by Magneto's group as they prepare to take drastic action.

The third act culminates with the X-Men embarking on an audacious mission to infiltrate Magneto's lair, where the antagonist and his cohorts are moments away from unleashing a catastrophic plan upon the world leaders gathered on Ellis Island for a historic event. As a battle rages on, Logan (35) musters all his strength to overcome the binds of Magneto's machine, with the survival of his allies—PETER PARKER (23), MJ WATSON (22), and the X-Men—hanging in the balance. A showdown ensues at the Statue of Liberty, where personal battles and the fate of the world intertwine, leading to intense confrontations, strategic sacrifices, and formidable displays of mutant abilities. Magneto's plans unravel, leaving him defeated, though the struggle's repercussions leave scars and set the stage for an uncertain future. In the aftermath, the implications of the Mutant Registration Act being defeated ignite hope among the mutants, and despite the ongoing challenges, the bonds between them are strengthened as Logan, still on a quest for self-discovery, acknowledges his connection to the X-Men before leaving on his own path. In a final, quiet moment, a chess match between Xavier and a now-captured Magneto hints at the enduring conflict and the unending game of strategy between opposing ideologies.
