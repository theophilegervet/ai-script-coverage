BEING SILVER
by
Liz Lachman
FADE IN:
OPENING CREDITS over home movie scenes showing images of the SILVER FAMILY in the late 1980’s.
A shy, attractive PHYLLIS SILVER(39) carrying baby VICTORIA, points to the camera and waves. Baby Victoria starts to cry.
Young FRANCIE(11), in a birthday “cone” hat, blows out her birthday candles. She elbows aside her angry brother, SAMMY(10). He pushes her. She hits him.
Dashing ARNIE SILVER(49) fixes the crawl sprinkler. He flexes his muscle for the camera. Young Francie runs into frame and hangs off her father’s flexed arm.
Two younger siblings, ROBBIE(8) and CHER(4), hold hands and run through the sprinkler. He’s naked. She’s dressed as Peter Pan.
Sammy and Francie run through the sprinkler. Phyllis, babe in arms, tries to control the wild scene. Pandemonium. She shoots a frustrated, overwhelmed look to the camera and hisses something we can only imagine.
A family pyramid is in the making. Arnie, flanked on either side by Francie and Sammy, re-plants Sammy’s hands properly and waves Robbie up. Robbie tenuously picks his way onto their backs and finally Cher clambers up next to him.
For a moment the family is suspended in time. Robbie slips and the human pyramid laughingly falls apart. But Arnie is not laughing. He angrily waves at the camera to cut...
END OF HOME MOVIES FADE UP:
EXT. LAWN - MORNING - PRESENT
A similar pyramid is in the works with A FATHER and FIVE CHILDREN of various ages. A Golden Retriever runs into frame barking. The triad tumbles down and they all laugh.
An impatient VOICE from somewhere calls out:
CHER(O.S.)
CUT! And reset!
We realize we actually are...
EXT. COMMERCIAL SET, BURBANK, CA - NOON
We see boom mikes, cameras, lights and CREW, all for the filming of a dog food commercial.
CHER SILVER(35) walks toward the actors. She wears an X-Men T-shirt and her frazzled brown hair falls out of its tie back. She appears to be hanging on for dear life while standing still.
CHER
OK, remember the part where I said the family’s happy? This looks like a funeral! I need happy!
The “family” members look at each other, puzzled.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(whispers to a CREW MEMBER)
I was happy once. About two hours ago.
CHER
Let’s do it over and this time-
Cher’s cell phone rings in a little tune that sounds suspiciously like “Forget Your Troubles Come On Get...”
CHER
(answers the phone) What!
Yoo-hoo.
Mother.
PHYLLIS (O.S.) CHER
Everyone groans and we hear someone call out:“Take ten...again!”
JUST OFF THE SET - MOMENTS LATER Cher weaves her way through cables and trucks.
CHER
I gave you this number for emergencies.
INT. SILVER HOUSE, KITCHEN - BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MICHIGAN - 3PM
PHYLLIS SILVER(now 71) is a well preserved beauty. She fixes sandwiches as she talks. On the wall is a framed PHOTO of the SILVER FAMILY all grown up.
PHYLLIS
I just want you to know I’m giving all your comics to Good Will.
INTERCUT - SILVER KITCHEN/COMMERCIAL SET
Cher trips on a cable.
CHER
What?!
PHYLLIS
You’re too old for all that-
CHER
I’m not old!
Phyllis plates the sandwiches and sets the table for two.
PHYLLIS
So come home and claim them. You know your sister’s giving birth any minute.
CHER
So you’re holding my comics hostage?
PHYLLIS
Family is a verb not a noun, dear.
CHER
(sighs)
How is Victoria?
PHYLLIS
The doctor has her on complete bed rest or he’s afraid she’ll go into early labor.
(calls out) Arnie!
(to Cher)
So she’s running your father’s business from the bed. That girl.
ARNIE SILVER(now 81)shuffles in and stands behind Phyllis, grinning. White hair and added pounds, but he still has the good looks of an aging, if befuddled Clark Gable. Phyllis turns to call him again.
PHYLLIS
Arnie- Jesus! Don’t sneak up on me. (to Cher)
Here, Dad wants to say hello.
An O.S. WORKER YELLS. Cher turns to see a truck in reverse almost upon her. She leaps aside.
Arnie takes the phone as he and Phyllis sit down to lunch.
ARNIE
So are you working? I saw that American Express commercial.
CHER
I didn’t direct that one but I just did-
ARNIE
-Now that’s a funny commercial.
CHER
(sighs)
Yeah, Dad, I know. It’s not-
ARNIE
Did you see the American Express commercial?
Phyllis takes the phone from Arnie and tucks his napkin into his shirt like a bib.
PHYLLIS
Arnie. Eat.
He pulls the napkin out. She tucks it back. He pulls it out.
ARNIE
I don’t want it!
CHER
Uhhh... Mom?
Cher ducks as a WORKER swings a two-by-four.
CHER
Hey!
WORKER
Sorry, Ma’am.
CHER
Ma’am?
(under her breath) Asshole.
PHYLLIS
This is how you talk at work?
Cher reaches the port-o-john and goes in.
INT. PORT-O-JOHN - DAY
Cher covers the mouthpiece to mute the spatter sound of pee.
CHER
Dad seems a little confused.
INTERCUT - PORT-O-JOHN/SILVER HOUSE KITCHEN
PHYLLIS
What? I can’t hear you! Are you in the kitchen? I hear water.
She tries to tuck Arnie’s napkin again.
PHYLLIS
Arnie, you want to have spots all over your front?
ARNIE
Leave it alone!
PHYLLIS
Fine! You’ll look like a mess.
ARNIE
Fine.
Fine.
PHYLLIS CHER
Mom, I gotta go.
PHYLLIS
Alright, dear. Think about coming home. For Chanukah maybe. God forbid you make a commitment but-
The phone SLIPS from Cher’s shoulder. She makes a frantic grab, bobbles it... and it plunges down the johnny-hole with a dull SLAP. Phyllis’s voice cuts through the shit.
PHYLLIS (O.S.)
I love you, Cher.
CHER
(leans over the hole) Love you too.
INT. SILVER HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
Phyllis hangs up and watches Arnie try to butter his bread. She takes it from him and butters it. Arnie brushes the front of his shirt with butter on his hand.
PHYLLIS
Jesus, Arnie! Look what you did!
She rubs at the stain with her napkin. He watches like a child.
INT. GAY BAR, WEST HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
Cher sits on a bar stool in the old-school lesbian bar surrounded by her FRIENDS. The jukebox blares ‘70’s DISCO as they do shots and slam the empties down.
CHER
You tell me why it wouldn’t work!
MUGSY
In legalese or just plain English?
The nay-sayer is MUGSY KLEIN(35), a fast-talking funny woman who could almost make you like lawyers. She holds an unlit cigarette and a mini pig-in-a-blanket balanced in the same hand. WENDY(36) and a very pregnant LISA(37) are next to her.
CHER
The elevator’s falling down the shaft...
SYBIL
Dropping like a rock. Are we on this again?
SYBIL(34), auburn hair, graceful, hugs Cher’s neck from behind. Cher unwraps Sybil’s hands from around her.
CHER
Sybil Bernstein, you’re strangling me.
WENDY
Does she always call you by both names?
SYBIL
Cuts down on the confusion. (sarcastic)
All those Sybils out there.
CHER
Excuse me? The elevator theory. So just before the point of impact you kinda hop into the air. Thereby avoiding impact.
LISA
Wait. If you’re inside the elevator, how do you know when the point of impact is?
WENDY
Besides the obvious physics issue here.
CHER
Maybe you just keep jumping up and down. That way you have a fifty-fifty chance of being in mid-air when it hits.
Beat. Cher’s friends burst out laughing.
CHER
Ok, you are NOT my friends.
Sybil kisses Cher on the lips.
SYBIL
I’m definitely not your friend. But you keep jumping up and down as much as you want.
Cher blushes as Mugsy slides over a flat wrapped package.
CHER
Hey, we said no gifts.
MUGSY
This is for Sybil, to explain why we say “to know Cher...
MUGSY,WENDY,LISA
...is to love her anyway.”
Sybil tears open the gift.
CLOSE ON A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO - Six year-old Cher, in her feet pajamas, struggles to move a small baby bookcase.
SYBIL (O.S.)
Wow. This explains a lot. Half the time I want to nail the furniture to the floor in her apartment.
MUGSY (O.S.)
Cher’s a big re-arranger from way back.
CHER (O.S.)
Talk about deck chairs on the Titanic.
Cher signals the BARTENDER for another round.
CHER
My mother had this weird expression she’d do. A vacant smile plastered on her face like, “I’m so happy.” She was depressed my whole childhood.
SYBIL
My mother was depressed too.
WENDY
Mine was too.
LISA
Yeah, mine too.
MUGSY
Come on, you guys. Not every mother was depressed. Mine spent every morning at synagogue, and then she-
(realizes)
Oh. Well, that’s fucked up. Thanks.
They sit for a moment realizing the truth about motherhood.
LISA
Show us the smile.
Cher gets a vacant look in her eyes and tilts her head to the side like the Mona Lisa. The women scream with laughter.
SYBIL
I never want to see that again!
Wendy raises her glass.
WENDY
To Cher and Sybil. On one year together.
LISA
Cher’s longest and most perfect fit.
They all drink.
CHER
The last nail’s not in the coffin yet.
SYBIL
This could be the nail, Babe.
Sybil gives Cher a small box.
CHER
Not a ring, I hope.
She opens the box and pulls out a necklace.
CLOSE ON NECKLACE - A fierce four-armed Indian goddess dances on a flaming dragon.
SYBIL
Her name was Kurukulla. The Tibetan goddess of war and fierce independence.
CHER
Well, I like that last part.
Sybil clasps the necklace around Cher’s neck.
SYBIL
Don’t let yourself feel too good.
CHER
I felt good when I was born. Then I got spanked.
WENDY
(looks closer at the charm) This is great, Syb. Did you make it?
SYBIL
Yep. Slaving over a hot kiln.
CHER
Thanks, honey. For my ugly little charm.
SYBIL
You’ll learn to love her and you’ll think of me.
CHER
I think of you right now.
Cher kisses Sybil for real. They both melt. Mugsy stands up.
MUGSY
And in honor of your goddess love I’m going outside to smoke.
WENDY
Mugsy. If you saw what your lungs looked like you’d never smoke again.
MUGSY
Wendy, if you saw what a uterus looked like you’d never have sex again.
LISA
You know there is a clinical explanation for Cher’s elevator theory.
Mugsy sits back down quickly.
MUGSY
Oooh. I can’t wait.
Cher’s one leg dangles, crossed over the other, her foot shaking like a paint mixer at a hardware store. She downs her shot.
LISA
I see it all the time with my patients. It represents an obsessive avoidance combined with a fear of growing up and creating adult emotional ties. In men it’s called the Peter Pan syndrome.
They all turn to Cher but she’s gone.
ON THE DANCE FLOOR - Cher dances wildly, singing along with ”You Can Ring My Bell.” She beckons suggestively to Sybil.
MUGSY
You don’t know whether to love her or raise her.
SYBIL
Tonight I pick: love her.
Sybil skips to the dance floor, joins Cher and the two dance with wild abandon to the old ‘70’s disco hit.
EXT. PARK - WEST HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT (LATER)
Cher and Sybil on the swing set, swing slowly next to each other and look at the full moon illuminating their faces. Sybil takes Cher’s hand.
SYBIL
Here’s a question for us-
CHER
So I was driving on the 405 today and I suddenly thought: what if a 747 had to make an emergency landing?
SYBIL
Do you love me?
CHER
Do you brake? Do you speed up?
Sybil hops off her swing in a huff and walks away. Cher leaps, stumbles, then follows Sybil.
EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
Sybil strides, angry. Cher follows, nervous, chatty.
CHER
And it would depend on which direction the plane was coming from...
Sybil passes between two parked cars and into the street. Cher stops. She eyes the bumpers, dreading the possibility of crushed legs. She bounds quickly through. Whew.
CHER
That was a trick question, right?
Sybil says nothing, just keeps walking.
INT. CHER’S APT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
Dark room. We can barely make out Cher and Sybil in bed. Then, a SLAP against pajamas.
CHER (O.S.)
Ow!
SYBIL (O.S.)
A trick QUESTION?!!
Another SLAP.
CHER (O.S.)
Ow! Well you surprised me!
SYBIL(O.S.)
Well what’s the answer now? With no surprise.
We can feel another slap waiting in the wings.
CHER(O.S.)
What are you, writing a book? (SLAP)
That wasn’t very hard- (SLAP)
Ow! Why are you hitting me?!
SYBIL (O.S.)
‘Cause at least I know you’ll FEEL it!
CHER (O.S.)
I feel it! Are you happy?
Beat. The bedsheets rustle.
SYBIL (O.S.)
No, I’m not. Why is everything a game?
CHER(O.S.)
Why does everything have to be so real? Can’t we just have fun?
SYBIL(O.S.)
Sure. It would be fun for me to know how you feel about me.
CHER (O.S.)
That’s your idea of fun?!
SYBIL (O.S.)
Achh! Grow up!
CHER (O.S.)
I’m up-
SYBIL (O.S.)
Cher. No one can get close to you.
CHER
I have an entire family who are all close to me!
CUT TO:
INT. ARNIE AND PHYLLIS’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Arnie snores on the bed in a t-shirt and Depends adult diapers. Phyllis sighs heavily and goes to his side of the bed, lifts his legs and pulls the covers over him. She gets into bed, snapping off the light. Eyes closed, her brow is furrowed as in anger.
Arnie’s snoring STOPS with a choke.
PHYLLIS
Arnie?... Arnie!
EXT. BEAUMONT HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - NIGHT
The PARAMEDICS hustle the gurney out of the ambulance as an EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR meets them.
PARAMEDIC
Labored breathing, BP’s way up!
INT. BEAUMONT HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
The doors BURST open, Arnie is wheeled in with an oxygen mask over his face. Phyllis follows, disheveled, pulling on her sweater.
PHYLLIS
He’s had two strokes.
EMERGENCY DOCTOR
What’s his name?
PHYLLIS
Arnold. Arnie. Arnie Silver.
EMERGENCY DOCTOR
Arnie? Can you hear me? Arnie!
PHYLLIS
I don’t think he understands-
EMERGENCY DOCTOR
Nurse!
An ER NURSE appears.
EMERGENCY DOCTOR
(to Phyllis)
Go with her, Mrs. Silver. We’ll need medical information on your husband.
Phyllis is pushed out and a white curtain SWISHES in front of her face. She stands dazed, clip board in hand, like an island surrounded by people doing their jobs. She catches her own reflection in a glass and instinctively checks her hair.
INT. BEAUMONT HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Phyllis dials her cell phone and listens. She has the appearance of a delicate piece of china with a crack.
PHYLLIS
Dotty? I’m at Beaumont with Arnie- I don’t know. He couldn’t breathe- I don’t know- Can I...- Can I talk?!
(her voice tightens)
Don’t call the kids, they’ll just be upset- We’re in emergency. Dot? Will you bring me a lipstick? I look terrible.
She hangs up and makes her way to a couch, sitting heavily, staring at nothing. A NURSE passes and Phyllis looks up with the exact smile that Cher had mimicked.
CUT TO:
INT. CHER’S APT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
Sybil and Cher face off in bed. The phone RINGS.
SYBIL (O.S.)
Get that and we’re over. I mean it. At some point in this relationship I would like to come first.
We can feel Cher trying to make a decision. She answers. Sybil explodes from the bed...
SYBIL (O.S.)
That’s it!
CLUNK.
SYBIL Ow! DAMMIT!
The LIGHT SNAPS ON. Sybil leans against the wall holding her nose. Cher sits up in bed in a Spiderman pajama top.
CHER
Are you okay?!
SYBIL
I liked the bed where it was!
CHER
(into the phone) Hello-
INT. RADIO STATION, SOUND BOOTH - DETROIT - 3AM
ROBBIE SILVER(39) bearded, handsome, sits behind a microphone, headphones on one ear. The lit buttons on the console reflect on his slender face in the darkened studio.
ROBBIE (O.S.)
It’s your favorite brother. Did I wake you?
Behind him are lots of vitamin bottles, some with Chinese writing.
INTERCUT - CHER’S BEDROOM/RADIO STATION - 3AM
CHER
Hey. You just going on the air?
Sybil gets up and walks out of the room.
SYBIL
I’m going home.
CHER
(whispers to her) Wait...
Cher realizes there’s been silence on the phone.
CHER
(into the phone) Yoohoo. Robbie?
Robbie’s eyes flutter as if in a seizure. Then he stares off into space, jaw slack.
CHER (O.S.)
Are you there?
Robbie snaps out of it. He jumps up and paces the length of his headset wire. He pops a pill from one of the bottles.
ROBBIE
I was just thinking about Mom and Dad. I think our whole family is afraid of intimacy.
CHER
I resemble that remark.
Cher paces in exactly the same manner. We now see that her pajamas are the complete Spiderman suit.
ROBBIE
Except for you. You and Sybil have got something. Something real.
(beat)
If she actually exists.
CHER
And you ever meet her. Which I will do my best to stop.
He chuckles. Then gets serious.
ROBBIE
You’ve really grown, you know.
CHER
Yeah, I groan a lot.
ROBBIE
Actually, you groan the most.
As the word game unfolds, we get the sense that within the rhythm is a familiar competition, each remark tossed out trying to top the one before. Cher distractedly plays with a rabbit puppet, still pacing.
CHER
Maybe I’ve OUT-groan everyone else.
ROBBIE
(laughs)
Well time to grown up, Cher.
Cher doesn’t laugh at the same message delivered twice in two minutes. She tries to see down the hall.
Robbie’s THEME MUSIC plays BG. The ENGINEER signals him from the booth.
ROBBIE
Gotta go.
INT. CHER’S APT, FOYER - NIGHT
Sybil is at the front door when Cher catches up.
CHER
Syb, wait-
SYBIL
You know what? I don’t ask for much and I just got nothing. And I know that you totally love me.
CHER
Then what’s the big deal? You need a public statement or something?
SYBIL
You’ll always win the argument, Cher. But what do you really win?
CHER
Maybe you just push too hard.
SYBIL
Tough life, huh? Saddled with a woman who adores you and pushes too hard and knows you better than you know yourself.
No.
CHER
SYBIL
Yes. Like I know you can’t ask me to stay right now. You can’t make it real for even a moment. Too intimate.
(Silence) Right.
Sybil walks out, closing the apartment door. Cher leans
into the corner, torn. And pissed. She flings open the door- to Sybil still there.
CHER
Aggh!
SYBIL
Like I knew you’d open the door.
CHER
Oh my god, you did not!
SYBIL
I know you. Now do you have something to say to me?
Sybil hopes, waits...
CHER
Uh.
(goes for the joke)
You forgot your toothbrush?
SYBIL
(explodes)
You know if you were that close to your family you wouldn’t live three thousand miles away!
Sybil leaves Cher standing in the doorway, searching for a snappy comeback.
CHER
Oh... yeah? Well.. OK, now I’m pissed! How’s that for a feeling?!
Cher angrily SLAMS the door.
INT. BEAUMONT HOSPITAL, INTENSIVE CARE NURSE’S DESK - NIGHT
DOTTIE GREENBERG(69) hurries past the NURSE down the hall. She is the quintessential stereotype of the Grand Dame Jewish matriarch; long fur coat, perfect nails and hair, designer glasses, and one pearl earring in her rush to go.
Behind her, mild-mannered IRV GREENBERG(70) picks up a newspaper and sits on the couch. Reading and waiting for Dottie are two things he has mastered in his life.
EMERGENCY NURSE
Ma'am You can’t go down there. I’m sorry.
DOTTIE
You’re sorry? Listen, no one’s gonna tell me-
DR. SCHWARTZ
Excuse me. Nurse? Is there a problem?
Handsome DOCTOR SCHWARTZ(42) approaches.
NURSE
Doctor, this is a restricted area.
DR. SCHWARTZ
I see.
(looks at Dottie) Mrs...?
DOTTIE
Greenberg. Of Greenberg’s Corned Beef and Rye. Ever hear of it?
DR. SCHWARTZ
Are you kidding? Who hasn’t.
DOTTIE
That’s right. So listen, you little pisher. My sister’s in that room alone with her sick husband and I’m going in there. Got a problem with that, Dr...
(reads his tag)
DOTTIE (CONT'D)
Ronald Schwartz?
(looks at him again)
Are you Hattie’s boy, Ronnie?
DR. SCHWARTZ
(smiles broadly) You know my mother?
DOTTIE
Know her? I used to beat the bloomers off her in high school basketball.
Dr. Schwartz takes Dottie’s arm like an entranced gentleman caller and walks her down the hall toward Arnie’s room.
DOTTIE
Your Aunt Sylvia too. How are they?
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Phyllis sits immobile, staring at Arnie. A small mechanical beep interjects as the ventilator breathes for him.
PHYLLIS’S FOOT - Crossed, dangling over her leg, shakes endlessly.
Dottie sweeps into the room and stops behind Phyllis, putting a hand gently on her shoulder. Phyllis reaches up and grabs it.
DOTTIE
Phyll. Did you call the kids?
Phyllis shakes her head, “no.” Silence.
DOTTIE
Guess who’s the doctor on call? Hattie Schwartz’s son, Ronnie. You know between you and me I always thought he was a little...
(gestures with a limp wrist) faygela.
For a moment Phyllis doesn’t move. Then she makes a small strangled sound like a squirrel.
INT. ICU NURSE’S DESK - NIGHT
The nurse starts to react as the sound of choking comes from Arnie’s room. She stops. Listens. It’s laughter.
INT. BEAUMONT HOSPITAL, X-RAY LAB - MORNING
Arnie’s lung x-rays on the light box. Phyllis stands somberly with Dr. Schwartz, Dottie and Irv behind her. Phyllis sways from side to side as the doctor speaks.
DR. SCHWARTZ
The tumor is blocking the entire lung and the lung has collapsed. The only way to get it out is to operate and, frankly, in your husband’s frail condition he’d never survive. We can keep him alive on the machines-
PHYLLIS
Oh, no. He signed a living will. No machines.
DOTTIE
Phyll. You have to call the kids. This isn’t the time for one of your little secrets.
CUT TO:
INT. FRANCIE’S APT, BEDROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C.- MORNING
The same Silver family PHOTO hangs on the wall. FRANCIE SILVER(42) is propped up in bed with a cup of coffee. On her bedside table is a dusty “victory” trophy holding a wreath.
THE ENGRAVED BASE READS - “To our best little girl on her birthday. Love, Mom and Dad.”
FRANCIE closes her eyes and digs into a small cloth bag. One by one she pulls out three Nordic Runes and lays the stones face down on the kerchief spread in front of her. She turns over the runes one at a time. The last one is BLANK. Francie GASPS. The PHONE RINGS.
CUT TO:
A button LIGHTS UP on a console as a silent phone rings. We are...
INT. RADIO STATION, SOUND BOOTH - 6AM
Robbie talks into the mic, headset on.
ROBBIE (CONT)
So I see two people who are so self- involved, they can’t do the right thing for their child. And has your son ever seen you and your wife make up after a fight?
MALE CALLER (O.C)
(on the phone)
But my wife’s crazy! She’s absolutely mentally unbalanced-
Robbie PRESSES the button, cutting the caller off. He presses another button.
ROBBIE
Brenda. You’re on the air with Dr. Silver.
Robbie opens one of the Chinese bottles and pops a tab. In the BG the ENGINEER in the control room answers the phone.
BRENDA (V.O.)
(screams to her children) Tiffany! Untie your brother!
(to Robbie)
Hi Dr. Silver. I just caught my eleven year old daughter sneaking out to meet a sixteen year old boy.
CLOSE ON ROBBIE’S PAPER - He has written “Brenda” but his handwriting turns unintelligible. Now it just stops, frozen.
ROBBIE stares into space, unfocused. Something’s wrong.
BRENDA (V.O.)
Dr. Silver?
BEAT. Silence.
A KNOCKING sound as the engineer knocks on the glass to get Robbie’s attention. He points at the phone in his hand. Robbie BLINKS a couple of times and “comes to.”
The SOUND of Brenda’s OC children laughing and screaming in the BG bleeds into...
CUT TO:
EXT. SAMUEL’S SILVER’S HOUSE, UPSTATE NEW YORK - MORNING
The sound of NOISY CHILDREN fills the air over the modest home among close-set houses. Five young orthodox Jewish CHILDREN play in the front. Toys litter the porch.
INT. SAMUEL’S HOUSE, HOME OFFICE - MORNING
SAMUEL SILVER(41) studies a book intently. He wears a white yamulka on his head, an untrimmed dark beard and long side curls tucked behind his ears in the tradition of the ultra orthodox Jew.
One leg crossed over the other, his foot dangles, unnoticed, shaking with excess energy. The office door bursts open and TWO YOUNG CHILDREN race in. The boy wears long side curls and a yamulka like his father.
BOY
Tatti! Is shark kosher?
SAMUEL
Well, let’s see. Does it have bones?
BOY
No!
SAMUEL
What does it have?
BOY
Ummm...
GIRL
Carpillage!
SAMUEL
Close enough. No bones, not kosher.
GIRL
I told you!
BOY
(yells OC to other kids) It isn’t!
They run out. He calls after them.
SAMUEL
Wash up for breakfast! And turn off the water this time! I’m not made of money.
Samuel’s wife, SHOSHANNA(35), pops her head around the door. She wears a head scarf and holds a BABY.
SHOSHANNA
Shmuel, I told them not to disturb you.
SAMUEL
It’s all right. I’m not learning a thing.
She comes in and closes the door. He sighs.
SAMUEL
Just tell me I’m a better father than my-
The phone RINGS.
EXT. GOLDMAN HOUSE, BLOOMFIELD HILLS - MORNING
CUT TO:
Sun peaks through the crisp bare trees, waiting for snow.
INT. GOLDMAN HOUSE, VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - MORNING
A bulletin board labeled “Names for Twins” with index cards in neat rows. From the next room, an OC TV blares.
VICTORIA SILVER-GOLDMAN(31) is propped up in bed, very pregnant, with a calculator and a clip board. On her night stand is the same picture of the Silver family that was in Phyllis’s kitchen and on Francie’s wall.
VICTORIA
(calls out) Norm? NORM!!
INT. GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM - MORNING
NORM GOLDMAN(41), a handsome slug of a man, stands in his pajamas, OJ in hand, mesmerized by the tube.
ON THE TV - A leopard tears apart a fawn on the Serengeti.
INT. VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Victoria sighs and struggles with her heavy body.
VICTORIA
Norman!!
INT. GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Victoria waddles out and stands with hands on hips.
NORM
Hey. You’re supposed to stay in bed.
VICTORIA
You know some couples play Mozart to their unborn babies in the womb.
NORM
(turns down the volume) All you have to do is ask.
Victoria sighs. The phone RINGS.
INT. MUGSY’S CAR - MORNING
CUT TO:
Cher leans over the back seat, repacking her open suitcase.
MUGSY
That cop is gonna ticket me cause you don’t have a seat belt. And then I’ll have to kill you.
(Cher sits back down) Did you call Sybil?
CHER
No.
MUGSY
You gotta call. What are you gonna do, leave town and keep it a secret?
CHER
She told me to grow up.
MUGSY
(faux horror) That bitch.
CHER
You call.
MUGSY
I’m not gonna call. You call.
They pass signs that say LAX.
CHER
Maybe this is better. I never feel more trapped than when I’m with someone.
MUGSY
And when you’re single you never stop looking for someone to be with.
CHER
I know the answer.
MUGSY
You’re a fucking nut?
Cher shrugs as if to say: “isn’t it obvious?”
INT. AIRPLANE - LATER
Cher plays video games on an old Gameboy. The MAN next to her leans over.
MAN
I used to have one of those!
CHER
MAN
Wow. Haven’t seen one in years.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Excuse me. You’ll have to put that away.
Cher sighs and stuffs the Gameboy into her bag. She puts on headphones and taps her ringed finger to the music, looking at her reflection in the window.
CUT TO:
INT. ANOTHER AIRPLANE - DAY
CLOSE ON A BOOK COVER: “The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying”
Francie reads and drains a vodka tonic. She is unaware of the constant shaking of her foot hanging from her crossed leg. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT brings another drink.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Are you heading home or doing business?
FRANCIE
I’m going to a... going away party for my father.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
That’s so sweet. Do you have a big family?
Just me.
FRANCIE
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Well, I hope it’s a helluva bash.
The flight attendant continues down the aisle.
EXT. DETROIT METRO AIRPORT - DAY
Irv’s car pulls away from the curb.
INT. IRV’S CAR - DAY
CUT TO:
Dottie fixes her hair in the passenger seat and uses the mirror to look at Cher in the back seat.
Cher studies her Peter Pan watch. She twists the watch fob back and forth and Peter’s arm “waves” at her. She smiles.
DOTTIE
God Bless your father, he was never kind to my sister.
IRV
Dottie.
DOTTIE
What? Everybody knows Arnie and I didn’t get along.
CHER
How’s my Mom?
DOTTIE
Exhausted. She’s been taking care of your father for twelve years.
(to Irv) Turn here, Irv.
IRV
I know, Dottie. (corrects her)
And it’s not twelve years.
DOTTIE
Eleven. That was his first stroke.
Cher hunkers down into her seat and looks out the window.
CHER’S POV OUT THE WINDOW - A heavily belted worker holds a jack hammer biting DATADATADATA into the concrete, almost drowning out the next dialogue... she wishes.
DOTTIE (O.S.)
And Victoria’s blood pressure is so high,
she could have a stroke.
IRV (O.S.)
Dottie!
DOTTIE
Let me tell you something. You better get Francie and Victoria to patch things up but fast.
CHER
Ive tried but-
DOTTIE
It’s ridiculous! Two sisters not speaking. Over the family business of all things!
IRV
Dottie, enough already!
DOTTIE
Turn right, Irv.
IRV
For Christ sake, you think I’ve never been to the airport before?
(he stops at a cross street) Ok. Which way?
DOTTIE
Left.
(to Cher)
Your brother’s driving in from New York right now.
CHER
Driving? Why?
DOTTIE
(shrugs)
There’s a kid who’s been fighting the world since he was born.
CUT TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Samuel’s maroon mini van HONKS, stuck in a traffic jam.
INT. SAMUEL’S VAN - DAY
Samuel hits the wheel.
SAMUEL
Dammit!
A lecture drones from the speakers.
REBBE (V.O.)
And when you’ve found your salvation as a good Jew, the result is inner peace.
Samuel begins to cry. He pulls out a handkerchief with shaking hands, holding it to his eyes.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - DAY
The ventilator HISSES loudly as Francie stands next to her father’s bed.
FRANCIE
(whispers)
Oh, please. Please take him God. (starts to cry)
Oh, Daddy.
Phyllis is there and tries to pull her daughter into a hug but Francie pulls away and sobs into her hands.
INT. VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - DAY
Victoria shifts uncomfortably in bed. Strewn around her are trophy figures and various wood bases. She tries out different figures on bases.
She sighs and looks at a small shining trophy at her bed side. She picks it up and reads the engraved plate at the bottom: “To Victoria, our best little girl on her birthday. Love, Mom and Dad.”
Victoria tears up. She dials the phone.
VICTORIA
Roberta?- Not so good.
She begins to weep but pulls it together.
VICTORIA
I need to schedule a manicure.
INT. ICU, NURSE’S DESK - DAY
Samuel passes TWO ICU NURSES at the desk. They look up and stare at his black coat, beard, side curls and black hat. The first Nurse looks knowingly at the second.
ICU NURSE #1
Jewish.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - DAY
Samuel enters, ignoring Francie and Phyllis and goes to the foot of the bed. He looks at his father.
SAMUEL
Hang in there, Dad. Keep fighting.
Samuel pulls a prayer book from his pocket, opens it, and sways, praying in Hebrew over Arnie. Francie rolls her eyes.
PHYLLIS
Samuel. He didn’t believe in all that.
Samuel ignores his mother and continues to pray. Phyllis walks out of the room but Francie stays, on silent guard.
INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - DAY
Cher stands stone-still in the elevator. She gives a slight hop in the air... just testing.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Cher walks down the hall with all the courage of the Cowardly Lion. As she approaches Arnie’s room she hears Samuel’s Hebrew prayer rising and falling. She flattens herself against the wall, peering unseen, into the room.
CHER’S POV INTO ARNIE’S ROOM - Samuel prays over Arnie. Francie, arms folded, eyes him with distrust.
Cher slips by the door and keeps walking, full of anxiety. Her cell phone RINGS, jolting her up against the wall.
CHER
(answers the phone)
What!- Yes, this is she- No, I can’t book a job right- American Express?! Hold on. Let me check my schedule.
Cher holds the phone away, silently and painfully mouths the words “Shit! Shit! SHIT!” She collects herself.
CHER
Ummm. I can be back in LA by-
NURSE
Excuse me. You’ll have to turn off your cell phone. Are you with the Silver family? You just passed the room.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - DAY
Cher sidles in and sees Arnie for the first time.
CHER
Jesus Christ.
Samuel STOPS, then picks up his droning Hebrew again. Phyllis gives Cher’s hand a tight squeeze.
INT. HOSPITAL, FAMILY WAITING ROOM - DAY (LATER)
The lights are low as Cher, Francie, Samuel and Phyllis sit waiting. Dottie and Irv sit quietly next to them. The tension in the room is palpable. Cher gets up and pulls a chair over from the other side of the room. She takes the chair next to it and moves it closer. The others exchange glances. Cher picks up the end of a sofa.
SAMUEL
What are you doing!?
PHYLLIS
Samuel. Leave her alone.
SAMUEL
It’s Shmuel, Mother.
PHYLLIS
I’ll call you what I named you.
Cher puts down the couch end and sits heavily.
CHER
Where’s Robbie?
PHYLLIS
I left him a message. (to Francie)
Did they feed you on the flight?
Francie sighs in exasperation at the question.
FRANCIE
Mother, I’m tired.
CHER
I got peanuts and pretzels.
PHYLLIS
Oh.
(beat)
That’s what I was making for dinner.
Cher looks up sharply. Then she realizes it was a joke. She keeps a dead-pan face.
CHER
Francie could always fricassee a chicken.
Beat. They wait. Dottie and Irv exchange worried looks. Samuel leans forward with the Silver word game and the same dead-pan look.
SAMUEL
It would have to cross the road.
CHER
Well that’s her cross to bear.
PHYLLIS
Why would a bear wear a cross?
They snicker. Francie can’t stand it any longer. She finally takes the dangling bait.
FRANCIE
Why not? The pope can shit in the woods.
They all laugh. Dr. Schwartz enters. They all stand.
THE FAMILY MEMBERS unknowingly sway from side to side in complete rhythm with each other.
Dr. Schwartz starts to speak but averts his eyes to keep from getting seasick.
DR. SCHWARTZ
I know the whole family’s not present but your mother has informed me that this will be sufficient for what we have to discuss.
(beat)
Your mother has decided to honor your father’s living will and terminate his life support.
The swaying STOPS. Francie exhales, holding back sobs.
DR. SCHWARTZ
At any rate, I-
SAMUEL
Let me ask you something, Doctor. This is how you’d treat your own father?
The Doctor clears his throat, uncomfortable. Samuel picks up angry steam.
SAMUEL
This is how modern medicine operates? Pull the plug and bang you’re dead?
PHYLLIS
Samuel. That’s not fair.
SAMUEL
Where’s the respect for human life? The man is here for, what? Five hours?! And now he’s just a slab of meat to get rid of? Jewish law says-
DR. SCHWARTZ
Respectfully, sir, under American law-
SAMUEL
American law evidently allows for murder.
CHER
It’s not murder-
SAMUEL
(yelling)
It’s the same as if they threw him out this window!
Cher sits down at the power of Samuel’s fury.
DR. SCHWARTZ
You must consider the quality of life-
SAMUEL
Who’s to say what quality of life is too little? You?! Him? God decides these things. It may come as a surprise to you, Doctor, but you’re not God!
FRANCIE
Let him go. It’s what he wanted.
Samuel slams out of the room. Cher sits, leg crossed over, foot shaking. Her thumbs work the buttons on the powered off Gameboy. Phyllis holds her head in her hands.
DOTTIE
Phyll. You can’t let your yeshiva- bucher son run your family.
DR. SCHWARTZ
Legally, the choice is yours, Mrs. Silver.
They all turn to Phyllis. She gets up and walks out.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
A frantic Samuel, on the pay phone bursts into tears.
SAMUEL
Rabbi! They’re going to kill him!
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
Cher finds Phyllis leaning against the wall. She sighs, leans next to her, looking for the right words.
Phyllis is barely aware of Cher’s presence.
PHYLLIS
So. If I honor my husband’s wishes, my son will never speak to me again.
Phyllis shakes her head and walks away, leaving Cher alone. Cher tries her cell - no signal. She sees the pay phones.
INT. ROBBIE’S CONDO, BEDROOM - DAY
The phone RINGS. Robbie sits in a stupor in a t-shirt and underwear. His eyes flutter, he gets up to answer.
ROBBIE’S POV OF HIS BEDROOM - a swirling maelstrom of bright lights. The SOUND swims.
Robbie’s legs buckle and he goes down.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Cher impatiently hangs up and looks at her watch. Two pay phones over, Samuel hangs up from his call. They stare.
SAMUEL
Someone has to do the right thing.
CHER
(sarcastic)
Lucky you. Most people live their whole lives trying to figure out what the “right thing” is.
SAMUEL
(looks pointedly at her) Obviously.
He walks away. Cher is furious. She flops down in the waiting area and pulls out her Gameboy.
CLOSE ON THE GAMEBOY SCREEN - The tiny blips move around. We peer over the screen at an anxious MOTHER and FATHER and their YOUNG DAUGHTER. The father holds his sleeping daughter on his lap and kisses her softly on the head. He smiles at the exhausted mother and squeezes her hand. PUSH IN CLOSER...
SWEEP ACROSS TO:
START FLASHBACK
A little hand wipes away fog on the window. Cher(4) races down the hall in Superman feet pajamas. We are...
INT. SILVER HOUSE, HALLWAY MORNING (SAME AGES AS IN P.1)
When she reaches Arnie’s office door, little Cher stops and flattens herself against the wall, hiding. She peeks in...
INT. ARNIE’S HOME OFFICE - MORNING
Arnie sits at his desk, scratches a huge black and white cat, PANDA, draped across his paperwork. Cher streaks past his doorway as quickly as she can, but-
ARNIE
Cherilyn!
She edges in and stands in the doorway. Arnie hands her some Easter Seals stamps.
ARNIE
Do you like these?
CHER
What are they?
ARNIE
They’re stamps. You lick them on the back and stick them on things.
Cher breaks into a sunny smile as Arnie hands them to her.
ARNIE
But not if you wet the bed again.
Arnie reaches down to hug her but Cher backs away and runs out. Arnie’s smile fades as he watches her. He pets Panda.
ARNIE
You and me, eh Panda?
INT. CHER AND VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Phyllis billows a rubber sheet over a twin bed.
CHER
(waves the stamps) Mommy, look what I got!
PHYLLIS
Don’t you want to be a big girl? Hmmm? Big girls don’t wet the bed.
Cher’s excitement drains away. She sticks her tongue out at Victoria standing in the crib.
CHER
Stupid!
Victoria starts to cry as Robbie scampers in.
ROBBIE
Mommy! Can Margie Wayne and me get married!?
Phyllis is unravelling. She balls up the soiled sheets and lifts the screaming baby out of the crib. Robbie continues to run around in a circle.
PHYLLIS
Robbie, stop running! (to the baby)
Shhh...
ROBBIE
(he stops momentarily)
Watch this, Mommy. When I grow up I’m gonna run for a job. Watch this!
He starts running in circles again. Cher waves her stamps.
CHER
Look what Daddy gave me!
PHYLLIS
Robbie, go get Francie.
ROBBIE
(runs out)
I’m getting married!
A moment later, a SCREAM from down the hall.
FRANCIE (O.S.)
Get out of here, you brat!
Francie, in her underwear, chases Robbie down the hall past Phyllis and the baby.
PHYLLIS
Robbie! Stop running! Francie! Come here! I need you.
FRANCIE
(glowering) I don’t need you.
PHYLLIS
Take the baby. I have to make the bed.
FRANCIE
Daddy didn’t say I have to!
Arnie comes in, tying his tie.
ARNIE
What’s all the noise about?
CHER
Robbie’s getting married, Daddy!
FRANCIE
Daddy! Just because Cher wet the bed, why do I have to do all the work?
ARNIE
For Christ sake, Phyll! Can’t you get Luvinia for that?
(calls out) Luvinia!
Francie shoots her mother a triumphant look and walks out. Phyllis tries to balance the baby, the balled up urine sheet and her fury with Arnie.
PHYLLIS
Listen. When I tell our daughter to do something I don’t expect to get undermined!
At the sound of raised voices Cher crawls under her desk.
ARNIE
If you can’t handle things around here by yourself-
PHYLLIS
By myself! That’s the problem!
Sammy chases Robbie into the room and corners him. He punches Robbie in the arm and Robbie SCREAMS.
SAMMY
Get the hell away from me! Maggot!
ROBBIE
(crying)
Mommy! Sammy hit me. And he said hell!
ARNIE
(to Robbie)
You! Stop that crying! Don’t be a sissy.
Robbie cries harder.
ARNIE
You want me to really give you something to cry about? Now stop it!
Robbie snuffles and hiccups. LUVINIA(30), an African American woman in a domestic uniform, enters, drying wet hands on a dish towel. Arnie walks out and Phyllis hands the screaming baby to Luvinia. Phyllis shakes Sammy.
PHYLLIS
You don’t hit your brother!
UNDER THE DESK - Within her sanctuary Cher begins to play, making two plastic horses fight each other.
SAMMY (O.S.)
I didn’t!
PHYLLIS (O.S.)
He’s your brother! (almost screaming)
You take care of your brother!
Sammy breaks free, trying not to cry.
SAMMY
You’re crazy! I’m running away!
PHYLLIS
Fine!
Phyllis throws open the closet door, grabs a small suitcase from the shelf and throws it violently at Sammy’s feet.
PHYLLIS
Here!
Sammy’s hurt is masked by his anger as Phyllis stalks out.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - DAY
Phyllis empties the dishwasher while Luvinia feeds Victoria in the high chair. Cher eats peanut butter on a spoon.
CHER
(to Luvinia)
Vinia, Daddy gave me stamps!
LUVINIA
That’s wonderful, Honey.
Sammy sidles around the corner with his suitcase.
SAMMY
Ok. I’m leaving now.
PHYLLIS
Ok. I hope you find a new family.
SAMMY
Don’t worry, I will.
A tortured high pitched WAIL...
ROBBIE
SAMMY!
INT. SILVER HALLWAY - DAY
Robbie runs to the door. Phyllis’s hand finds her heart at the panic in her son’s voice.
ROBBIE
You forgot your toothbrush! (no answer)
You’re missing my wedding!
EXT. SILVER DRIVEWAY - DAY
CLOSE ON - The needle is dropped on a 45 record. The Wedding March plays.
Francie, Cher, Phyllis and Luvinia with the baby are gathered together with assorted NEIGHBORS.
From behind a hanging blanket we can see small excited movements. Robbie and little MARGIE WAYNE step proudly out.
The neighbors start to laugh. Phyllis FREEZES into her Mona Lisa smile... Robbie is in the bridal gown.
EXT. SILVER DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON (LATER)
Cher watches as her mother’s car pulls out of the driveway, crunching grey salted sludge under the tires.
INT. PHYLLIS’S CAR - AFTERNOON
Phyllis drives looking as if she’s about to cry. Panda’s black and white head appears in the back seat.
EXT. FIELD - AFTERNOON
Phyllis’s car pulls up. The car door opens and Panda is pushed out. The car squeals away.
INT. PHYLLIS’S CAR - AFTERNOON
Phyllis sobs, gripping the wheel. She looks in the rear view mirror at the small black and white furry creature and sobs harder. Then she SNAPS on the radio and gradually stops crying. She gets the beat of the music, tapping her wedding ring on the steering wheel. Her face takes on that same empty smile.
INT. SILVER BATHROOM - NIGHT
Phyllis bundles the baby in a towel out of the bath.
INT. SILVER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Cher Robbie and Francie watch TV.
CHER
Where’s Panda?
The SOUND of the garage door opening...
PHYLLIS (O.S.)
Your father’s home!
The kids scatter... except Francie who runs toward the garage.
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
Arnie sits in his car, hesitant, tired. Through the door he hears the baby’s SCREAMS and Phyllis’ muffled yell and his shoulders sag. Then he straightens and sighs.
INT. CHER AND VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cher sits on her bed, pretending to read a book. She hears Arnie’s jangling change in his pockets as he approaches down the hall. Closer. The jangling STOPS.
ARNIE (O.S.)
Shit!
The door opens.
ARNIE
What the hell is this?!
He points to the Easter Seal stamps in neat rows affixed to the bedroom door.
CHER
Ss-stamps. You told me to-
Arnie grabs Cher by the arm and SPANKS her hard.
ARNIE
You get those off of there right now, God dammit!
Cher melts into tears and crawls under her desk. Cher’s sobs hold Arnie for a moment in the hall. He turns to go back in, but stops, rubbing his aching forehead.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - NIGHT
Francie dances around Arnie as Phyllis heats leftovers.
FRANCIE
I’ll make dinner, Daddy! I can fricassee a chicken!
PHYLLIS
Francie, bed.
Arnie pets Francie’s head.
ARNIE
She can stay up, Phyll. (to Francie)
Fricassee a chicken, huh?
Phyllis is furious. Francie beams up at her father. Something catches Arnie’s eye and he opens the kitchen sliding door with a smile. A bedraggled Panda comes in. Phyllis and Panda glare at each other.
END FLASHBACK
INT. HOSPITAL, FAMILY WAITING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - PRESENT
Francie slouches in the chair, huddled under a blanket, unable to sleep. She starts to cry and stops herself.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Phyllis sits in the chair next to Arnie accompanied by the ever-present hiss of the ventilator.
PHYLLIS
Well? Not exactly what we expected.
Cher peeks around the corner and watches her mother, a mixture of fear and longing in her face.
EXT. GOLDMAN HOUSE - NIGHT
The snow falls under the moonless sky.
INT. VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Norm sleeps but Victoria shifts, trying to find one comfortable place. She suddenly puts a hand to her belly.
VICTORIA
(smiles and whispers)
Norm? You want to feel something?
Norm SNORES. Victoria’s smile fades in the emptiness.
INT. ROBBIE’S CONDO, BEDROOM - NIGHT
Robbie lies on the floor. He pulls the phone toward him by the cord, inch by inch.
INT. SILVER HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Phyllis and Cher sit at the large formal dining table, dwarfed by its size. Cher looks up a few times as if to say something but Phyllis simply drinks soup and thumbs through a Neiman-Marcus catalogue.
CHER
Mom? Um, Robbie thinks we have trouble being intimate in our family. Do you?
PHYLLIS
Not really dear. You know I saw some nice slippers for you in one of these catalogues.
CHER
I don’t need slippers.
PHYLLIS
I have to go through the stack. Victoria’s always yelling at me to throw them away.
She shows Cher a picture of slippers.
PHYLLIS
There. You like those?
CHER
I guess. But what I was- (sees the picture)
Oh! Those are nice.
The phone RINGS and Phyllis moves to the kitchen. CLOSE ON A CATALOGUE PICTURE OF WHITE FUZZY SLIPPERS.
PHYLLIS (O.S.)
I thought you’d like them. (answers the phone)
Hello?
(panicked) Robbie?!
CUT TO:
INT. BEAUMONT HOSPITAL, INFECTIOUS DISEASE WARD - NIGHT
A GREY HAIRED DOCTOR stands with Phyllis and Cher.
GREY HAIRED DOCTOR
The AIDS virus is in the brain.
Phyllis looks around in embarrassment at the mention of the word “AIDS” to see if anyone has heard.
GREY HAIRED DOCTOR
He’s showing signs of dementia. How long has he been HIV positive?
PHYLLIS
(lowering her voice) About 11 years.
GREY HAIRED DOCTOR
The fever seems to be exacerbating the symptoms.
GREY HAIRED DOCTOR (CONT'D)
So we’re bringing the temperature down and hopefully he’ll regain some of the brain function. What AIDS medications is he on?
CHER
None. He’s does alternative healing.
The doctor sighs in disgust.
PHYLLIS
Can we start him on some drugs? For the...
(lowers her voice)
...you know.
CHER
He’ll never agree to it.
GREY HAIRED DOCTOR
Without his permission we can’t do it.
PHYLLIS
But I’m his mother.
GREY HAIRED DOCTOR
Do you have Medical Power of Attorney? (silence)
Without that paperwork, as soon as he’s stable we have to release him.
PHYLLIS
But he can’t be on his own like this!
GREY HAIRED DOCTOR
You can try to care for him at home. Or you can look into hospice care. Of course they won’t give him life- sustaining aid. I’m sorry. I wish there was a better solution.
INT. SYBIL’S APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - 2AM (P.S.T.)
Sybil, covered in paint smears, pushes her hair out of her face, leaving a smudge on her forehead. She sits in front of her latest canvas. The phone RINGS and she grabs it.
CLOSE ON THE OIL PAINTING - A brightly colored impressionist rendition: Cher, Sybil, Mugsy, Wendy and Lisa laugh together.
SYBIL (O.S.)
Hello?
(silence) Hello...
INTERCUT SILVER HOUSE/ SYBIL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Cher sits under her childhood desk on the carpet with her Gameboy off, but in her lap. Her voice is tight with panic.
CHER
Ok, you know what I’d do if a plane landed on the freeway?
SYBIL
Heyyy. Are you okay? I’ve been so worried.
Bail out.
Cher?
CHER
SYBIL
(silence)
I could hop a plane and be there by tomorrow morning.
(still silence) You want some company?
CHER
I’m still the same age as when you left.
That hurts Sybil. She just sighs into the phone. ON THE PAINTING - The friends laugh in a whisper...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HOSPITAL OUTDOOR AREA - SUNRISE
Samuel sits on a bench whispering in Hebrew. His breath fogs the cold air as he bobs back and forth, eyes closed. A leather strap around his head holds a small leather box in place on his forehead. Another box is strapped around his wrist.
INT. SILVER HOUSE, KITCHEN - SUNRISE
Dottie and Phyllis sit at the kitchen table in silence. Dottie’s cigarette smoke mingles with the steam from her coffee.
DOTTIE
Why didn’t you tell me, Phyll?
PHYLLIS
What’s to tell? He’s gay? (beat)
Fine. He’s gay.
Dottie smokes in the silence between the sisters.
DOTTIE
Well, you can’t take care of him. Not with everything going on. We’ll just have to put him somewhere till we can figure it out. I mean there are drugs now-
PHYLLIS
You know what Arnie said when I put him to bed last week? He looked at me and said: “You’re a good wife.”
(beat)
You know what I thought? “Now you tell me.”
Dottie looks at Phyllis and realizes she’s going to have to take control. She digs through some crap on the counter and slaps a phone book down.
EXT. HOSPICE OF THE GOOD ANGELS - MORNING
A brick building separated from the road by snow covered grounds and an American flag.
INT. HOSPICE OF THE GOOD ANGELS - MORNING
Dottie and Phyllis walk into a hushed, carpeted foyer. A marble statue of Mary and the Baby Jesus greets them.
PHYLLIS
Oh, Jesus.
DOTTIE
Shh. At least it’s clean. He’ll never know it’s Catholic.
SISTER MICHAEL(O.S.)
May I help you?
They turn to SISTER MICHAEL in full nun’s habit. Phyllis looks dryly at Dottie. Dottie smiles politely at Sister.
EXT. GOLDMAN HOUSE - MORNING
Norm scrapes ice from the windshield while the car idles.
INT. VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Victoria is propped up in bed, talking on the phone, while Cher examines the baby names on the bulletin board.
VICTORIA
(on the phone)
Just re-do the placque he scratched and pack it separately.
CLOSE ON THE BOARD - Colored index cards, each with a name printed on it, are paired together. Cher writes in: “Batman” and “Robin.”
VICTORIA (O.S.)
Get that out today. OK. Bye.
VICTORIA hangs up and huffs in agitation. Cher drops the pen like a naughty child.
VICTORIA
Well. Another inept employee of Dad’s. I don’t know how he managed before me.
CHER
Vic? Can we talk about Francie?
VICTORIA
You know the doctor’s constantly telling me how much danger I’m in. They’re talking about high blood pressure and strokes.
Cher waits for an answer. Finally...
VICTORIA
It’s not MY fault! It was a stupid idea to try to put Francie into the business Dad and I built.
CHER
You mean that Grandpa and his Dad
built.
VICTORIA
I made it run right. Then “Her Royal Highness” comes home and everybody kowtows, Why? Why is everyone always pussyfooting around Francie?!
CHER
‘Cause she’s always leaving.
VICTORIA
Yeah. She left the company after a month!
CHER
You know why.
VICTORIA
Mercury was in retrograde or some other crap! I’ve tried. She’s the one who hasn’t spoken to me in years.
CHER
Vic. You kinda replaced her.
VICTORIA
Oh you’ve had way too much therapy.
CHER
I didn’t know that was possible.
Norm comes in, blowing on his hands.
NORM
Ok. I’m off.
VICTORIA
Will you pick up some orange juice on your way home tonight?
NORM
Can’t it wait till the weekend?
VICTORIA
Norm! Just do what I’m asking you. It’s one little thing.
NORM
Fine.
Fine.
VICTORIA
He leaves the room and Cher realizes she’s just witnessed her parents’ relationship. Victoria sighs and leans back.
VICTORIA
I just wanted for my kids what we had... a big happy family. I always thought it would be great to take them over to play with Dad.
CHER
(totally confused)
We are talking about our Dad, right?
VICTORIA
I just feel like it’s all falling apart. He knew so much about everything.
CHER
Except fathering. And kindness. Love...
VICTORIA
Whatever.
INT. HOSPITAL, FAMILY WAITING ROOM - MORNING
Phyllis, Dottie and Cher are there with Francie looking ragged. Cher’s foot shakes a mile a minute and she absent- mindedly plays with the Kurukulla charm around her neck.
RABBI HERSHFELD (65), graying at the temples, dressed in a suit and tie with a black yalmukah on his head, sits next to Phyllis.
RABBI HERSHFELD
And Dottie, how is Irv?
DOTTIE
He’s fine, Rabbi. Can’t find his way out of a paper bag, but otherwise fine.
Samuel comes in and Phyllis and Rabbi Hershfeld stand. The Rabbi puts out his hand to shake Samuel’s.
RABBI HERSHFELD
Samuel. Good to see you again.
Samuel clasps his hands behind his back and nods. The Rabbi slowly retracts his hand.
Doctor Schwartz enters followed by NURSE HOLLOWAY, a middle aged waspish looking woman. Dottie introduces Rabbi Hershfeld to the doctor while Phyllis pulls Samuel aside.
PHYLLIS
Don’t be rude to the Rabbi, Samuel.
SAMUEL
(correcting her)
Shmuel, Mother. And he’s not my Rabbi.
PHYLLIS
He’s still my Rabbi.
SAMUEL
Barely even a Jew.
PHYLLIS
Well then what am I? What’s your father? Did you even visit your brother?
(silence)
For God’s sakes, he’s two floors up!
SAMUEL
(ignores her)
Doctor. I’ve talked to the Rebbie and what we want to know is this: is there any function that you have to do to the machine that would demand that my father be off of it for any period of time?
There is a collective held breath as the family waits. A sudden LOUD SCRAPING NOISE and they all turn with a GASP. Cher STOPS, mid-chair rearrange.
CHER
Sorry.
SAMUEL
If there is, and you just didn’t restore him to the machine, he could die naturally not because of something we did.
DR. SCHWARTZ
Well, we have to clean the pump, how often Nurse?
NURSE HOLLOWAY
Every twelve hours. We do take him off the machine for a few seconds then.
Francie glances at Cher, who looks frozen, waiting.
NURSE HOLLOWAY
We could clean the pump and leave Mr. Silver off the machine.
SAMUEL
The Rebbie says that under Jewish law that would be a natural death.
CHER
(stands suddenly)
Wait. What’s the difference? Yesterday it wasn’t ok-
SAMUEL
The Rebbie determined it!
CHER
But-
Francie SLAPS Cher’s arm, silencing her.
RABBI HERSHFELD
And when would you do this?
NURSE HOLLOWAY
(looks at her watch)
...in about eight hours.
RABBI HERSHFELD
Phyllis?
Phyllis looks at Francie who gestures “about time.” Phyllis looks to Cher. Cher shrugs with disgust and nods.
PHYLLIS
I think we should go ahead.
DR. SCHWARTZ
I’ll make the arrangements.
Doctor Schwartz leaves the room.
RABBI HERSHFELD
(to Dottie and Phyllis)
That would make it at 8pm and today’s Monday. I would be able to do the funeral-
(takes out a pocket calendar) Let’s see. I have a Bar Mitzvah tomorrow.
(decides) Tomorrow night.
Rabbi Hershfeld starts writing in his calendar.
PHYLLIS
Oh. No! It can’t be tomorrow night, I won’t have the house ready for guests.
The Rabbi erases his writing.
RABBI HERSHFELD
Well... I have a consecration on Wednesday afternoon. I guess I could fit the funeral in on Wednesday morning if it’s early enough. We’ll still be within the 48 hour limit.
RABBI HERSHFELD (CONT'D)
(writes in the date) Alright then.
(takes Phyllis’s hand) I’ll talk to you tonight, Dear.
He walks out. Cher turns and looks out the window. A lone worker shovels the snow away from the entrance walkway.
FRANCIE (O.S.)
(to the nurse) Will he be in any pain?
NURSE HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
No. What will happen is this...
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MORNING
Dottie catches up with the Rabbi part way down the hall.
DOTTIE
Rabbi?
INT. HOSPITAL FAMILY WAITING ROOM - MORNING
Nurse Holloway is explaining the basics.
NURSE HOLLOWAY
Once we remove the breathing apparatus he’ll just go to sleep. He’ll be gone in about five minutes.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MORNING
Dottie walks with Rabbi Hershfeld.
DOTTIE
May I ask you something?
RABBI HERSHFELD
Certainly, Dottie.
DOTTIE
How much money do you suppose Irv and I have given the synagogue over the years?
Rabbi Hershfeld stops walking.
RABBI HERSHFELD
You’ve always been extremely generous.
DOTTIE
Then you won’t mind what I’m about to say.
RABBI HERSHFELD
Of course not.
DOTTIE
(her demeanor changes)
You will damn well move that god damned consecration and be there for my sister, or I will cut you off so hard you’ll think you just had a second circumcision! You got that, you ungrateful son of a bitch?
The Rabbi’s face is white, his smile frozen in place.
INT. HOSPITAL, FAMILY WAITING ROOM - MORNING
Phyllis stands next to Cher watching the shoveler outside on the walk. He finishes the walk and moves on.
PHYLLIS
That’s something isn’t it? He just shovels. And then he’s all done.
CUT TO:
EXT. HOSPICE OF THE GOOD ANGELS - DAY
Phyllis, Dottie and Sister Michael walk down the snowy walkway. Cher follows paces away, pushing Robbie in a wheelchair. Robbie has impaired motor nerve function and his eyes have trouble focusing. Cher leans down to him.
CHER
(thumbs toward the Sister) Hey, who’s the penguin?
No answer. Cher straightens and tries to fight down her rising panic.
SISTER MICHAEL
We’re here to make the transition easier, to help people to return to God as comfortably as possible.
INT. ROBBIE’S HOSPICE ROOM - DAY
From the bed, Robbie looks around silently, like a baby bird trying to focus. Phyllis tucks him in and then moves the chair and rearranges the items on the table.
PHYLLIS
This looks better over here...
Cher watches her mother and her brother. Suddenly her breaths come in shaky jagged gasps. Dottie takes Cher’s arm and pulls her into the hall.
INT. HOSPICE HALLWAY - DAY
Dottie lowers her voice.
DOTTIE
Buck up, kiddo.
Cher’s breathing starts to slow.
DOTTIE
Listen, it’s going to be up to you to get Robbie to sign the medical power of attorney papers.
CHER
What? He doesn’t want the drugs.
DOTTIE
Lie to him. That’s what family’s for. Think of something or he’s gonna die. And your mother can’t take that now.
(beat)
I’m going to get the car.
INT. ROBBIE’S HOSPICE ROOM - DAY
Phyllis pulls out a plastic Chanukah menorah from her bag and places it in the window. She screws in two orange, flame-shaped light bulbs and plugs the menorah in. It lights the window in an orange glow.
PHYLLIS
Wherever you go, you make a little Shabbos for yourself.
She looks into the room across the hall.
PHYLLIS’S POV OF THE ROOM ACROSS THE HALL - A BRIDE in full
bridal gown and veil sits on the bed of her feeble ELDERLY FATHER, holding his hand, whispering and smiling. Next to her is her new GROOM.
INT. HOSPICE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
The bride leaves the room. Someone taps her shoulder.
PHYLLIS
Excuse me.
INT. ROBBIE’S HOSPICE ROOM - DAY
Robbie sits up in bed, listless, with Cher beside him.
PHYLLIS
Yoo-hoo. Someone’s here to see you.
A mound of white lace and taffeta peeks around the corner.
BRIDE
Are you Robbie?
Robbie sees the bride and lights up, a smile spreading across his face.
INT. HOSPICE HALLWAY - DAY
Phyllis swings herself out along the wall. She stands for a moment, numb. She won’t break. Silent tears come.
Cher goes to her mother, haltingly, and puts her arms around her in a clunky, uncomfortable motion. Phyllis sobs and Cher holds her patting her back like a child.
CUT TO:
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - 8PM
The family crowds around Arnie’s bed; Samuel in silent prayer; Cher stands at the foot of her father’s bed; Victoria in a wheelchair, glances nervously at Francie- who ignores her. A creaking sound as Phyllis pushes Robbie’s wheelchair into the room. Phyllis tries to take her place next to Arnie at the head of the bed but Samuel won’t budge. Phyllis physically squeezes herself in, pushing a scowling Samuel aside.
The only sounds in the room are the “shushing” of the ventilator and an insistent small “beep.” Robbie’s thumb moves in a circular, continuous pattern. Doctor Schwartz and Nurse Holloway are at the top of the bed.
Robbie chuckles.
ROBBIE
Sammy, remember when you hid acid in the fridge and Mom found it?
Samuel’s prayer stops. Phyllis smiles her fake smile and clears her throat in embarrassment.
DR. SCHWARTZ
Ready?
Phyllis nods. Nurse Holloway takes the apparatus from Arnie’s face and swabs the inside of the mask with alcohol doused cotton. She lets it dangle at the side of the bed.
NURSE HOLLOWAY
It will be few minutes now.
They all look up at the clock.
CLOSE ON THE CLOCK - The hands point at 8:15pm.
SWEEP ACROSS TO:
START FLASHBACK
EXT. SILVER HOUSE - MIDNIGHT - 1995
Scattered night lights as the house sleeps. On Francie’s closed door a sign with her name and “DO NOT DISTURB.”
INT. ARNIE AND PHYLLIS’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Phyllis sleeps alone in bed.
INT. ARNIE AND PHYLLIS’S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
IN THE DRESSING ROOM - A dresser drawer is carefully opened and a flashlight shines in on rolls of socks. The drawer opens further to reveal a hand gun.
SAMMY (O.S.)
(whispers) See? I told you.
Sammy(now 16),Robbie(now 14), Cher(now 10) stand over the drawer, staring at the gun. Sammy reaches in.
ROBBIE
(whispers) You better not!
In the BG the SOUND of the garage door going up. Sammy SLAMS the drawer and they scatter.
EXT. SILVER DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
Arnie’s car illuminates the garage door as it sticks half way up. Arnie gets out and we hear a muttered “goddammit!” as he struggles with the door.
INT. CHER AND VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cher hears the sound of her father’s jingling change in his pockets as he comes down the hall. She feigns sleep.
The door cracks open and Arnie tiptoes into the room. He tucks Cher in and kisses her hair. Cher opens her eyes as he leave the room.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - NIGHT
Arnie warms the food left for him on the stove. We hear a “damn!” as he burns himself.
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Arnie sits alone and eats. He feels something at his leg, smiles down, and rubs Panda’s belly with his foot. The faucet runs in the kitchen.
ARNIE
Phyll?
It’s me.
ROBBIE (O.S.) ARNIE
I want to talk to you for a minute.
INT. SILVER HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cher peeks around the corner.
CHER’S POV OF DINING ROOM - Robbie sits at the table and half of Arnie’s back can be seen.
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Arnie stamps out his cigarette on his empty plate.
ARNIE
Have you been thinking about what you might like to do for a career someday?
ROBBIE
I’ve been thinking about being a nurse.
ARNIE
You know I always wanted to be a Doctor. Do you think you’d like that?
ROBBIE
No.
ARNIE
(losing patience)
It’s a very respected profession. Much more so than nursing.
ROBBIE
I don’t care.
INTERCUT - HALLWAY/DINING ROOM
Cher dances the Mr. Rabbit puppet from around the corner. Robbie looks back at his father, trying not to laugh.
ARNIE
You know when I was young, Jews didn’t have the opportunities that you do.
ROBBIE
I know.
ARNIE
So don’t go wasting it on being a nurse!
ROBBIE
(a flare of defiance)
Mom did it! It wasn’t a waste for her!
Arnie visibly swallows his frustration.
ARNIE
I want to tell you something about your mother that you’re old enough to hear.
Cher stops dancing, straining to hear. Arnie leans in to Robbie, man to man.
ARNIE
Your mother’s not well.
ROBBIE
(face goes pale) Wh..what do you mean?
Arnie makes the cuckoo signal with his finger at his head.
ARNIE
Up here. There’s something wrong with her. She’s mentally unbalanced.
ROBBIE
She is not!
Robbie stands up so violently that his chair tips over.
ROBBIE
She is not! She is NOT!
ARNIE
Don’t you raise your voice to me!
ROBBIE
(yells)
I don’t believe you! (bursts into tears)
I don’t believe you!!
INT. SILVER HALLWAY - NIGHT
Robbie races by Cher and SLAMS the bathroom door.
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Arnie sighs and rubs his aching forehead. Panda jumps into his lap and Arnie strokes the cat.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cher lays on the carpet, puts her finger under the bathroom door and moves it around. Robbie keeps sobbing. Then his sobs catch as he’s clearly seen Cher’s finger. A small giggle from the bathroom. Cher smiles.
INT. ARNIE’S OFFICE - MORNING
A FRAMED PHOTO ON THE WALL shows eight smiling young men and their saxophones. A very young Arnie is one of them, beaming with pride.
In the BG, someone struggles to play the saxophone.
INT. SILVER LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Arnie plays his soprano sax to “I’ll Be Seeing You” on radio. He hits a sour note.
ARNIE
Damn it.
PHYLLIS (O.S.)
Shoo! Shoo!
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - MORNING
Phyllis has a long broom, trying to scare away a crow from the transom window above her.
PHYLLIS
Get away from there!
Arnie peeks around the corner and smiles at Phyllis and her crow. Phyllis sees him and shyly shoos him away with a flirtatious wave of her hand. He laughs and disappears.
INT. SILVER HOUSE, FRANCIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Francie(17) smokes a cigarette and sketches. She smiles at herself in the mirror, posing as if at a dinner party.
FRANCIE
(to her reflection) Why, yes, thank you.
CLOSE UP OF DRAWING - A quite good rendition of a wedding ceremony. The bride looks like Francie. The groom's face is undrawn.
INT. SAMMY AND ROBBIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Sammy and Robbie work completely absorbed on a model airplane.
Cher and the Mr. Rabbit puppet slowly rise into view behind Sammy’s head. Robbie smiles. Mr. Rabbit appears to be reading the directions over Sammy’s shoulder.
INT. SILVER LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Arnie plays another bad note and angrily hits the saxophone bell against a metal chair back.
ARNIE
Idiot!
He looks at the bell of the sax. Dented. He’s furious.
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - MORNING
Phyllis is still chasing the crow which hasn’t noticed her. Victoria appears with Phyllis’s pearl necklace.
VICTORIA
Mommy, can I have this?
Arnie enters with saxophone in hand.
ARNIE
Enough already with the broom!
PHYLLIS
I don’t want it up there pecking.
Phyllis waves her arms around.
ARNIE
What the hell do you care?!
INT. SAMMY AND ROBBIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
As the voices raise in the BG, Sammy suddenly whirls, grabbing Mr. Rabbit off of Cher’s hand.
CHER
Give it back!
Sammy hurls Mr. Rabbit against the wall. He starts strangling the puppet. Cher screams in agony.
CHER
Stop it!
Arnie angrily looks into the room. Everyone freezes.
ARNIE
I want you boys to oil the garage door today! It’s been sticking.
Cher grabs Mr. Rabbit and runs out crying.
ARNIE
And turn out this light! I’m not made of money!
Arnie strides by Phyllis and Victoria with his brief case.
PHYLLIS
That’s right! Run away to work!
Arnie grabs a large serving platter on the sink and heaves it against the wall with a CRASH!
INT. SILVER HOUSE, FRANCIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Francie laughs into the mirror and rolls her eyes.
FRANCIE
Oh, I know. You just can’t get good help.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - MORNING
Victoria sways side to side behind Phyllis.
ARNIE
Don’t you ever criticize me! I provide the roof over your goddamn head!
INT. CHER AND VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - MORNING
A small desk is pushed across the floor as the YELLING continues in the BG.
CHER
There’s where you should go. You’re better over there.
(looks at the desk) That feels better, right?
A door SLAMS in the BG and the yelling stops.
INT. ARNIE AND PHYLLIS’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Phyllis cries face down on the bed.
ROBBIE
Mom?
(no answer)
Mommy? Are you OK?
Robbie sits and pets Phyllis’s back. Her sobs subside. He hands her a Kleenex and she blows into it and sighs deeply.
PHYLLIS
(hugs him)
You’re going to grow into such a nice man someday.
INT. SILVER HOUSE - NIGHT
Calm in the sleeping house.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
The garage door sticks half way up. Arnie gets out and tries to pull it up but slips and falls on the ice.
INT. CHER AND VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cher puts the light out and hides under the covers. Arnie’s jangling pocket change and firm stride doesn’t break as he goes past her door.
INT. SAMMY AND ROBBIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
The boys are jolted awake as the door BURSTS open and the light goes on. Arnie stands infuriated in the doorway.
ARNIE
What did I tell you boys to do?
Sammy and Robbie, completely disoriented, don’t answer.
ARNIE
What did I tell you to do?!
SAMMY
Oil the garage door.
ARNIE
Did you do it? (no answer)
Did you do it?!
SAMMY
No.
Arnie is like an enraged bull. He stalks over to the newly finished model airplane and SMASHES it to the floor. Robbie SCREAMS and starts to cry. Sammy leaps to his feet, eyes flashing fury.
ARNIE
You’ll damn well remember the next time I tell you to do something!
Robbie runs out of the room. The bathroom door SLAMS. Sammy stands furious, almost as tall as Arnie.
ARNIE
You got something to say?!
SAMMY
Fuck you!
Arnie SLAPS Sammy across the face. Sammy raises his fist. Arnie’s slaps rain down on him hard around him.
ARNIE
You want to be a big man? You get the hell out and make your own living! Then you can be a big man like me!
SAMMY
(warding off the blows) I’ll never be like you!
Arnie strides out. Sammy kneels and starts to pick up the shattered bits of the airplane.
INT. SILVER HALLWAY - NIGHT
Phyllis stands in her bedroom door with a disapproving frown.
EXT. SILVER HOUSE - MORNING
PHYLLIS (O.S.)
Arnie!
INT. ARNIE’S HOME OFFICE - MORNING
Phyllis runs in holding a note in her shaking hand.
PHYLLIS
Sammy’s gone!
She grabs the phone and starts to dial.
ARNIE
He’s sixteen. Let him grow up.
She puts down the phone and races from the room, sobbing. Arnie sighs and tries to refocus on his paperwork. Panda stares at him. He answers, defensive.
ARNIE
What.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING
Cher and Victoria trundle down the drive to the bus stop.
VICTORIA
Do you think Sammy will come back?
CHER
Yeah. Don’t worry.
VICTORIA
I want his bathroom drawer.
EXT. FIELD - DAY
Phyllis’s car rolls up, the door opens and Panda is dropped out. The door SLAMS and the car drives away.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - NIGHT
Arnie stands at the stove warming his food. He looks around waiting for the cat. No Panda.
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Arnie sits with his plate and looks under the table. Nothing.
INT. ARNIE AND PHYLLIS’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Arnie slips into bed next to Phyllis.
ARNIE
Phyll. Phyll? Where’s Panda?
PHYLLIS
(mumbles in her sleep)
I don’t know. Maybe he ran away.
Arnie lays down worried and sad.
INT. ARNIE AND PHYLLIS’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Arnie excitedly shakes Phyllis awake.
ARNIE
Guess who’s home!?
PHYLLIS
Sammy?!
Panda rubs himself around the corner and stops in his tracks, eyeing Phyllis. She covers her head with a pillow.
END FLASHBACK
CLOSE ON the clock. The hands point out 8:30pm. Fifteen minutes later. We are...
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT
The family stands in exactly the same positions.
NURSE HOLLOWAY
I don’t understand. He’s breathing.
The siblings and Phyllis exchange looks of mixed emotions. From outside in the hall, a PHONE RINGS.
SAMUEL
You see? God decides.
FRANCIE
Shut up, Samuel.
CHER
What do we do now?
PHYLLIS
Doctor?
DR. SCHWARTZ
Well... this is, uh... highly unusual.
NURSE #2
(head in the door)
Mrs. Silver? The phone is for you.
INT. ICU, NURSE’S DESK - NIGHT
Phyllis grasps the phone.
PHYLLIS
Hello?
INTERCUT - RABBI HERSHFELD’S OFFICE/NURSE’S DESK
Rabbi Hershfeld sits at his desk with an understanding look.
RABBI HERSHFELD
Phyllis. I’m so sorry for your loss. He was a good man.
PHYLLIS
Oh, Rabbi. I’m so sorry. He’s still alive.
Rabbi Hershfeld is stunned. He sighs and begins to erase in his calendar.
CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL, FAMILY WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
The family sits in various positions throughout the room, exhausted. Victoria talks on her cell phone from her wheelchair. One leg hangs off the foot plate on the wheelchair and shakes.
VICTORIA
I don’t know why he didn’t, he just didn’t. Norm. Will you just come pick me up? Fine. Bye.
Dr. Schwartz enters.
DR. SCHWARTZ
Well, he’s breathing on his own. If he lasts more than a few hours, it presents a new issue. The part of the brain that governs some of the local nerve functions has been affected. Your father can’t swallow. If we try to feed him by mouth he’ll choke.
SAMUEL
What are the options?
DR. SCHWARTZ
Feeding tube. Inserted directly into his stomach. Of course he’ll try to take it out so we’ll have to restrain his hands.
PHYLLIS
(moaning)
This is not what he wanted.
DR. SCHWARTZ
Or don’t feed him and let him die naturally.
SAMUEL
You mean starve him to death? This is natural?
Cher begins to fidget. As Samuel keeps talking, she looks as if she’s on the edge, about to blow.
SAMUEL
What kind of man are you? This is a human being we’re talking about! If he didn’t die then it’s what God wants!
CHER
(finally exploding)
What are you, some direct line? You don’t know what God wants!
SAMUEL
I know it’s not for us to say!
CHER
(standing)
You’ve certainly been having your say all over the place!
SAMUEL
You fly into town with your twisted lifestyle and have the nerve to tell me-
FRANCIE
Let him go, Samuel. You’re only delaying the inevitable!
SAMUEL
(to Dr. Schwartz)
I will sue this hospital for every penny if you don’t feed him right now...
(turns to Phyllis)
...and I will sue you if you let him die! That’s American law!
They all start squabbling at once. Phyllis gets up and walks out. Dr. Schwartz follows her. Everyone looks at each other.
CHER
Great.
She digs into her bag and shakily gets her Gameboy out.
SAMUEL
Is that all you can do? Act like a child?
CHER
Just cause you have a million children doesn’t make you MY father.
The rage surges into Samuel’s face. He SMASHES the Gameboy against the wall and strides from the room.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Samuel angrily rushes out past Phyllis and Dr. Schwartz. Phyllis looks beaten.
PHYLLIS
I guess we’ll do the feeding tube.
INT. HOSPITAL FAMILY WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
Francie, Victoria and Robbie watch as Cher picks up the smashed orange plastic on the floor. Finally...
ROBBIE
I think he’s mad.
Beat.
FRANCIE
I think he’s a mad cow.
Another beat.
VICTORIA
Or a raging bull.
They wait for Cher to somehow be the glue... She gets up and walks out. The moment of camaraderie gone, Francie puts up an icy exterior. Victoria’s face crumples.
FRANCIE
I’m going to get something to eat.
INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT
Cher sits at a table with a coffee and her pieces of orange Gameboy. Francie enters, gets coffee and goes to a different table to sit. Cher rolls her eyes and goes to her sister’s table. They say nothing for a moment.
CHER
Do you think there’s something wrong with us?
FRANCIE
Define “us.”
CHER
Victoria said that-
FRANCIE
-That’s Kurukulla.
CHER
What?
FRANCIE
Around your neck.
CHER
Oh. Yeah. Tibetan Goddess of war and independent thinking or something...
FRANCIE
Tibetan goddess of love.
CHER
No, she’s supposed to govern all the fighting-
Francie examines the necklace and points it out to Cher.
FRANCIE
Kurukulla enchants gods and humans to serve and love her. See the lotus flower in one of her hands?
CHER
(looks down) Yeah?
FRANCIE
And see the bow and arrow?
CHER
Yeah?
FRANCIE
And see the lotus position she’s in?
CHER
Yeah.
FRANCIE
Beat.
(shrugs) It’s Kurukulla.
CHER
Really.
FRANCIE
Yeah. I thought everybody knew that.
CUT TO:
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - DAY
Cher sits at the dining room table, dark circles under her eyes, holding a mug of coffee and looking at an old photo.
CLOSE ON PHOTO - Robbie and Cher as children, side by side holding hands and look seriously into the camera.
A TINGLING BELL fades up in the BG. As the sound gets louder, it’s actually many bells playing the song “Greensleeves.” Cher scrambles from the table.
INT. SILVER HALLWAY - DAY
Cher throws open the door, smiles and waves at the ice cream truck.
CHER’S POV OF ICE CREAM TRUCK - The DRIVER waves back. The
truck recedes and the jingling melody gradually disappears.
AT THE DOOR - Cher stands alone, staring down the empty street. A car pulls into the driveway. Mugsy gets out.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
Cher’s eyes go wide. She runs over and hugs Mugsy.
CHER
Are you crazy?!
MUGSY
(thumbs to other side) It’s kinda going around.
Sybil gets out of the passenger side. Cher is flabbergasted. Sybil goes to her and hugs her. Cher silently holds on for dear life. Sybil and Mugsy exchange a glance.
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Cars zoom by on the busy boulevard.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Mugsy, Sybil and Cher sit with coffee mugs.
CHER
Lisa had her baby!?
MUGSY
Last night. A bouncing baby boy. Wendy’s all proud, like she did it.
CHER
Were you there? In the room?
MUGSY
Yeah, that’s right up there on the list with “hearing your parents have sex.” The only place I wanna see a baby is in the blanket.
CHER
So. They have their little family.
SYBIL
They? You don’t get away so easily, “Godmother.”
MUGSY
We figured we should bring you home before the kid starts walking and talking and knocks over a liquor store-
SYBIL
Which won’t be long with Mugsy around.
Cher doesn’t laugh. Mugsy changes track.
MUGSY
How’s Robbie?
CHER
(sighs)
He won’t take the drugs. The only way I’m gonna get him to sign over medical power of attorney is if I trick him. So now I have to lie.
MUGSY
Oh, fuck.
SYBIL
What does he say when you talk to him?
CHER
(shakes her head)
It’s like my brother’s gone missing.
Cher stops herself from tearing up as Sybil takes her hand. Cher pulls away, in her own world.
CHER
You know how I spent my childhood? Trapped and furious. Now...
MUGSY
You know what? You just gotta do the right thing, here. Fuck everybody else.
INT. SILVER LIVING ROOM - EVENING
The sky is streaked with orange and fiery red as Dottie reaches in and pours Phyllis and herself a large shot of Vodka. Phyllis sips, then picks up the phone and dials.
DOTTIE
Who are you calling?
PHYLLIS
As Arnie would say, enough is enough. I’m taking out the feeding tube.
INT. HOSPITAL FAMILY WAITING ROOM - EVENING
Francie listens on the phone, wiping tears away.
FRANCIE
What about Samuel?
INTERCUT - SILVER LIVING ROOM/FAMILY WAITING ROOM
PHYLLIS
It’s not his decision. Okay, Dear. I love you.
Phyllis waits, then sighs and hangs up.
PHYLLIS
Not neat. It can never be neat. (beat)
Ahh, Dottie. Life is just a mess.
DOTTIE
Yeah. One big God-damned mess.
The two sit together drinking and watching the sunset.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - EVENING
Dr. Schwartz looks over Arnie’s chart. Francie dozes with a book on her lap.
Arnie’s hands are in cloth restraints and a milky substance pumps through a hanging tube that disappears under the sheets. The doctor reaches up and scrolls the wheel that turns off the food substance in the IV. Then he quietly opens the Velcro restraints.
Ron studies Francie’s face and curiously leans over her.
CLOSE ON THE BOOK - The title reads: “The I-Ching-Book of Changes” An elaborate mish-mash of pencil lines has been drawn, but the words “creative-father” and “the gentle- first daughter” stand out.
Ron fixes the blanket around Francie. Suddenly she grabs his hand in her sleep, like a child. He stays and pets her hair lightly, gently watching over her.
INT. ROBBIE’S HOSPICE ROOM - EVENING
Cher sits next to Robbie’s bed while Robbie sips milk from a milk carton with a straw. He speaks quietly.
CHER
You know this intimacy thing with the family isn’t so easy. I’m trying but...
ROBBIE
You know wearing a diaper is okay.
Cher goes still.
ROBBIE
If I want to go, I just go. I don’t even have to get up. Like right now I’m going.
Cher looks at him and her ragged panicked breath starts again. Mugsy and Sybil walk in. Robbie looks at Mugsy with no recognition. She trips into the door, Chaplin-esque.
ROBBIE
(smiles) Mugsy Kline.
MUGSY
At your service, Dr. Silver.
CHER
And this is Sybil.
Sybil sits next to Cher on the bed and Robbie smiles and takes her hand.
ROBBIE
About time.
INT. VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - EVENING
Victoria, on the phone, wipes tears from her eyes. The orange light of the setting sun illuminates her room.
VICTORIA
Ok. Yeah. Mom? Can I come over?
INT. ROBBIE’S HOSPICE ROOM - EVENING
Cher holds a piece of paper on the table in front of Robbie, her thumb covering the heading on the page.
CHER
This is a meals agreement for while you’re here.
ROBBIE
The food’s good.
CHER
(fighting back tears)
See? You already agree with the meals.
The joke falls onto empty air as Robbie tries to sign. His signature is unreadable and goes off the line. Cher reaches down and steadies his hand and the words “Medical Power of Attorney” are suddenly visible at the top.
Cher picks up the next sheet labeled “Financial Power of Attorney” and puts it down in front of Robbie, covering the heading again.
CHER
This is a back up copy.
She watches his slow signature and she seems more and more agitated, fighting a breakdown. Sybil squeezes her shoulder.
INT. ICU, NURSE’S STATION - NIGHT
Samuel stops at the nurse’s desk.
SAMUEL
How’s he been tonight?
ICU NURSE
About the same.
Samuel makes his way down the hall toward his father’s room.
INT. ROBBIE’S HOSPICE ROOM - NIGHT
Cher is on the phone and Sybil sits on the bed with Robbie.
SYBIL
You know what I’m thinking?
ROBBIE
That my sister’s a pain in the ass?
SYBIL
Yeah. And it runs in the family.
He grins.
CHER
(voice low in the phone) So what do you think, Wen?
INT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - LOS ANGELES - EVENING
Wendy, on the phone, in doctor’s coat with stethoscope around her neck, signs papers while she talks.
WENDY
It’s bad, Cher. I told him about the new drugs available but it sounds like Robbie’s had some brain atrophy. I hope it’s not too late. If he’ll even take them.
INT. ROBBIE’S HOSPICE ROOM - NIGHT
Mugsy moves to the window and screws in another orange flame-shaped light bulb into the menorah.
SYBIL
You guys are smart. But you’re all in your heads too much, ya know?
ROBBIE
Yeah.
SYBIL
(touches his heart) Where’s this?
ROBBIE
Do you think I should take the drugs?
SYBIL
Yeah, I do.
ROBBIE
Okay. I will.
Cher stops, incredulous, and just stares at Sybil.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Samuel sits next to Arnie’s bed and closes his prayer book. He takes Arnie’s hand and realizes that it’s NOT in restraints. He suddenly moves the sheets, looking for feeding apparatus. There is none.
INT. ICU, NURSE’S STATION - NIGHT
Samuel races to the desk.
SAMUEL
Where’s the feeding tube?!!
ICU NURSE
It was removed. The Doctor ordered it.
SAMUEL
On whose authority?!
INT. HOSPITAL, FAMILY WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
Francie sleeps on the couch under a blanket as Samuel BURSTS in and rips the cover off of her. She rises to meet him.
Murderer!
SAMUEL
FRANCIE
LET HIM GO! Your guilt won’t fix it.
Samuel draws back as if to hit Francie. She doesn’t flinch.
FRANCIE
I dare you.
He backs down in fear, then runs out.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Samuel’s hand plunges into a pitcher of ice water. He holds a piece of ice to Arnie’s lips. As the ice dribbles onto his lips and into his mouth Samuel leans closer. His eyes widen.
CUT TO:
INT. PHYLLIS’S CAR - NIGHT
Cher, Mugsy and Sybil drive in silence.
MUGSY
Who knew? All she did was ask.
Sybil starts to giggle. Then laughs out loud.
EXT. KLINE HOUSE - NIGHT
Cher’s car pulls up. Mugsy gets out and goes to the house.
SYBIL
Are you ok?
Cher shrugs.
What.
SYBIL
CHER
(bursts)
It’s all so easy for you! (mimics)
Cher, you have to open up, Cher, say I love you, Robbie take some drugs... I’m not a fucking puppet!
SYBIL
I know-
CHER
And I didn’t ask for your help, I don’t need your help! And Kurukulla was the goddess of love, so you lied to me!
SYBIL
Ok I lied! About a charm. So?
CHER
So it’s my garden and you’re stomping through it picking all the flowers! No wonder I haven’t said I love you!
Sybil is stopped.
SYBIL
You owe me an apology.
She SLAMS the car door on her way out.
INT. PHYLLIS’S CAR - NIGHT
Cher drives angrily through the closed storefronts. She feels for the Kurukulla at her neck.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - NIGHT
Phyllis and Victoria look at a Neiman-Marcus catalogue over salads. Suddenly Samuel bursts in, his face red with fury. He grabs the plates from the table and flings them CRASHING against the wall.
SAMUEL
Enjoy your meal while your husband starves to death!
VICTORIA
Samuel, you-
SAMUEL
You call yourself a wife?
PHYLLIS
(rises)
I know what your father wants and it’s not a slow death with no dignity!
Samuel pushes Phyllis roughly against the wall.
VICTORIA
(screams)
Stop it! Just stop it!!
INT. SILVER HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cher comes through the door.
CHER’S POV OF THE KITCHEN - Samuel pins Phyllis against the wall while Victoria SCREAMS, trying to pull him away. Cher barrels down the hall.
SECONDS LATER - Cher YELLS above the din.
CHER (O.S.)
CUT!
They all STOP. Cher has Arnie’s GUN trained on her brother.
CHER
I mean STOP.
Samuel releases Phyllis. All are breathing hard.
PHYLLIS
(to Cher) Are you crazy?!
CHER
Me!?
SAMUEL
He can swallow!
PHYLLIS/CHER
What?
SAMUEL
I was there. They said he couldn’t but Dad swallowed. He can eat. And you’re no better than butchers! All of you!
He stomps out of the house, SLAMMING the door behind him. Cher’s hand starts to shake as she lowers the gun.
PHYLLIS
What were you thinking?! A gun?
CHER
Mother. The safety’s on. I don’t even know how to-
The gun FIRES into the floor and they all SCREAM.
PHYLLIS
Oh my God!
(drops to her knees, moans) Ohh, my good tile.
Cher puts the gun down gingerly and helps her mother clean up the broken glass. Victoria leans over to help.
VICTORIA
Shit!
PHYLLIS
I know, what a mess-
VICTORIA
(doubled over in pain) Ohhhh...
INT. BEAUMONT HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY - NIGHT
The doors burst open and Victoria, moaning in pain, is wheeled in by Norm, flanked by Phyllis and Cher.
PHYLLIS
(to anyone)
Emergency!! She’s premature!
INT. VICTORIA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Victoria lies writhing in pain in bed while Phyllis massages her lower back. Norm watches the Animal Planet on TV.
PHYLLIS
Cher, get me a cold cloth.
INT. VICTORIA’S HOSPITAL BATHROOM - NIGHT
Cher grabs a washcloth and turns on the faucet. Her reflection in the mirror shows a near panic attack.
INT. VICTORIA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Phyllis takes the cloth from Cher.
PHYLLIS
You don’t look so good. Go get some air. Don’t disappear, I need you.
Cher passes a NURSE entering the room as she leaves.
VICTORIA (O.S.)
Please. Gimme drugs! Gimme something!
OB NURSE (O.S.)
Oh, Honey. This ain’t nothin’ yet.
INT. HOSPITAL RESTROOM - NIGHT
Cher BURSTS in and stands at the sink, holding on for dear life. She splashes her face with cold water and grabs some paper towels, but the dispenser sticks. Cher PULLS at the dispenser and it’s suddenly all too much.
CHER
God dammit!
(pounds the dispenser) Fuckin’ GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK!
A toilet FLUSHES and A NUN in white habit comes out of a stall. She doesn’t meet Cher’s eyes as they stand at the sinks together.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Samuel sits next to a barely conscious Arnie, feeding him clear broth from a spoon.
INT. HOSPITAL, FAMILY WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
Francie sits at the table with a cup of tea and tarot cards. Phyllis enters, exhausted.
PHYLLIS
I want to talk to you.
FRANCIE
I’m busy, Mother.
PHYLLIS
You have to talk to Victoria.
FRANCIE
I don’t want to discuss-
PHYLLIS
You are going to listen to me!
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Nurse Holloway comes in and takes Arnie’s pulse.
SAMUEL
You know, my father has done the right thing his whole life.
NURSE HOLLOWAY
I’ll bet you were proud of him.
SAMUEL
(glares at her)
Am proud of him. You take care of your family. It’s a commitment to God.
INT. HOSPITAL FAMILY WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
Phyllis is losing patience.
PHYLLIS
What happened was not Victoria’s fault, it was your father’s.
FRANCIE
Blame the one who can’t talk back-
PHYLLIS
He put you both in a bad position!
Francie is quiet. Then she turns, eyes flaring.
FRANCIE
She was in MY chair. It was MY desk. And he told me to pull up the secretary’s chair and help her, like I was the assistant!
PHYLLIS
And she was your younger sister.
FRANCIE
And she sat there so smug I could’ve killed her-
PHYLLIS
Stop this! You’re a child-talking about children’s hurts while your sister’s in real danger. If something happens to her it’ll be too late. Now we are going to start acting like a family, or I will break somebody’s goddamned neck!
Both of them stop, shocked at Phyllis’s authoritative tone. Francie turns back to her Tarot.
CLOSE ON ONE TAROT CARD - “The Fool” WINKS HIS EYE at
Francie as he skips over the cliff edge.
FRANCIE EXPLODES out of her chair. She looks again at the card, closer. It’s just a card.
Samuel appears sullenly in the doorway.
PHYLLIS
(snaps at Samuel)
Robbie’s all alone at the hospice. I want you to go be with him.
Samuel looks away as Phyllis brushes past him and out. Beat. Finally Francie tsks in disgust.
FRANCIE
I’ll go.
INT. VICTORIA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - 2AM
Victoria SCREAMS with pain, clamping on to the nurse’s hand. Cher cools Victoria’s head with a cold cloth as Phyllis massages her back. Norm sleeps in a chair in the corner as Phyllis’s distress grows.
PHYLLIS
Oh God. It will be over soon. I promise. We’ll go shopping, we’ll-
The nurse lets go of Victoria’s hand-Victoria SCREAMS.
VICTORIA
Get back here!!
The nurse takes Victoria’s blood pressure.
OB NURSE
We’d better get them outta there.
Phyllis gets up and goes to Norm. She kicks the chair and slaps his head.
PHYLLIS
Get your goddamn butt up and help!!
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - 2AM
Victoria moans all the way down the hall.
VICTORIA’S POV FROM THE GURNEY - Norm’s concerned look... the nurse pushes the gurney from the end...Samuel suddenly appears on her right.
SAMUEL
Victoria, this is Sol Lipschitz, the mohel.
A VERY ORTHODOX JEWISH MAN with glasses and scraggly black beard takes Samuel’s place, keeping up with the fast pace.
SOL LIPSCHITZ
Victoria, it’s very important that your sons are circumcised by an orthodox mohel or they won’t be truly Jewish. I would be happy to perform the-
VICTORIA
AGGHHHHHH!
All goes white and fades out...
SERIES OF SHOTS - ECHOED SOUNDS OF THE BIRTH
FRANCIE sleeps in the chair in Robbie’s room.
ROBBIE lays listlessly in bed. He turns and sees the electric menorah in the window. He smiles weakly.
SAMUEL prays in the maternity ward waiting room as Norm paces.
SYBIL slowly packs her suitcase. She looks at the phone.
CHER rests her chin in her hands, balancing elbows on knees, looking at Arnie. She tentatively takes his limp hand in hers.
END SERIES OF SHOTS
EXT. HOSPITAL - SUNRISE
Over the fiery sunrise we hear a whispered HEBREW prayer.
PHYLLIS(O.S.)
Shemah Yisroel..adonai eloheynu, adonai echad.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - SUNRISE
Phyllis holds Arnie’s hand. Cher awakens in the chair across from her and watches her mother.
Something distracts Phyllis, although Cher has heard no sound. Phyllis shivers, drops Arnie’s hand, then looks expectantly at the doorway.
The nurse’s phone RINGS and the muffled voice of the O.C. nurse answers. She appears in the door.
NURSE HOLLOWAY
Mrs. Silver? Your son just phoned from upstairs. You have two new grandsons and your daughter’s doing fine.
Phyllis smiles. She breathes a long sigh of relief.
CHER
(studying her mother) You already knew, didn’t you?
PHYLLIS
Cher, refill the pitcher, will you?
Phyllis seems very calm as Cher leaves.
PHYLLIS
(to Arnie)
Did you hear that? Two healthy grandsons and Victoria’s fine.
EXT. ICU HALLWAY- MORNING
Cher flattens against the wall outside the door and listens.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - MORNING
Arnie’s eyelids flutter slightly. His eyes open and he stares at Phyllis. Phyllis is still holding his hand. He smiles faintly.
PHYLLIS
So. We’re going to be fine. Everything will be as it’s meant to be. Go.
EXT. ICU HALLWAY, MORNING
Cher trembles, bites her lip and furiously blinks back tears. She grabs the chair in the hallway to rearrange its position. The chair won’t budge. Cher pulls harder.
Nothing. She looks.
THE FEET OF THE CHAIR are bolted to the floor.
Cher wildly pitches around trying to find some piece of furniture not nailed down. They all are. She grabs the pay phone as if it’s the only life line she’s ever known.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - MORNING
Phyllis holds Arnie’s hand and smooths his thin white hair. Arnie blinks slowly. A tear slides down his cheek. She starts to hum. The hum turns into a very low croon...
PHYLLIS
(sings softly)
Did I remember to tell you I adore you...
INT. KLINE HOUSE - BLOOMFIELD HILLS - MORNING
Sybil answers her cell phone.
SYBIL
Cher?
INTERCUT - INT. HOSPITAL HALL/KLINE HOUSE - MORNING
CHER
(trying to keep it together)
Ok. Ok. You know how you walk between two parked cars, and you don’t know if they could roll and cut your legs off-
SYBIL
What happened?
CHER
I can’t do this I can’t watch people
die I can’t feel this I don’t want to I-
SYBIL
Cher. You’re strong. You’re brave.
Cher’s knees buckle and she slides down the wall to the floor, still on the phone, crying and gulping for breath.
CHER
I’m not. I never learned this, he taught me balancing my checkbook I can’t do this-
SYBIL
It’s okay. You can. I’m here, you’re not alone. Let me help, Cher-
(a CLICK sound) Cher?
Cher leans against the wall, her breaths breaking into a sob, then into choking sobs. Her cell phone vibrates and is ignored.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S ROOM - MORNING
Phyllis sings to Arnie as his eyes close. The sound of the heart monitor goes to one long flat tone.
The EIGHTIES HOME MOVIE reappears as Phyllis sings (V.O.)
The children all dance around a young Phyllis in a rare moment of family joy. Phyllis waves at the CAMERA then the children wave and the picture slowly fades to BLACK.
INT. HOSPITAL, FAMILY WAITING ROOM - MORNING
Francie sleeps in a chair. A HAND pets her hair and she looks up to see a younger, healthier Arnie looking down lovingly. She smiles up and... he slowly fades.
INT. ICU, ARNIE’S RO0M - MORNING
Nurse Holloway turns off the monitor and the silence is deafening. Phyllis inhales a huge breath and exhales as if finally letting go. She smiles a real smile at Arnie.
SAMUEL
(rushes in excitedly)
Mom! You should see how tiny they-
Nurse Holloway puts her finger up and shakes her head. Samuel stops in his tracks, realization flooding over him.
He bursts into tears and throws himself across his father’s bed. He stands, sputters a prayer in Hebrew and with great ceremony, takes off his coat and rips his white shirt.
Still speaking Hebrew in cadence he moves to Phyllis. He grabs at her lapel to rip it but she fends him off.
PHYLLIS
Are you crazy? This is a five hundred dollar blouse!
CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL, NURSERY - MORNING
A small placard reading “SILVER-GOLDMAN” is on the base of two incubators head to head with two tiny PREMIE BABIES.
INT. VICTORIA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
Victoria lies in bed, feels her belly no longer full. A small knock at the door reveals Francie. Victoria wipes her eyes as Francie sits down. Silence. Francie is formal, uncomfortable.
FRANCIE
How are you?
VICTORIA
I’ve been better.
FRANCIE
I saw the babies. Cute.
BEAT.
VICTORIA
(trying for the family game) How about those tanning booths.
FRANCIE
Dad’s gone.
VICTORIA
Yeah.
FRANCIE
He said goodbye to me.
They sit and say nothing, both alone in the room.
INT. HOSPITAL FAMILY WAITING ROOM - MORNING
Cher sleeps fitfully in a chair. A HAND brushes her cheek. Her eyes open and she looks at Sybil like a grateful child. Sybil folds her in her arms. Mugsy enfolds both of them and the three stay there.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - EVENING
Dottie and Irv sit with Phyllis and Cher at the dining room table. Cher watches her mother carefully. Phyllis seems in a daze. Dottie has the situation firmly in hand.
DOTTIE
Alright, you’ll need chairs for the shiva.
(looks around, figuring)
...about twenty.
PHYLLIS
Twenty-five.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - EVENING
Francie, eyes red and swollen, washes dishes with a vengeance.
DOTTIE (O.S.)
Twenty folding chairs then. And we’ll bring our prayer books for the service.
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - EVENING
Cher takes Phyllis’s hand.
CHER
Mom, you want something to drink? Water?
Phyllis just shakes her head “no.”
DOTTIE
Do you have ice?
PHYLLIS
You know when Arnie and I were first married I was crossing the street and a car just nicked me in the heel. I did a somersault right there and landed in the middle of the street.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - EVENING
Francie stops doing the dishes and listens.
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - EVENING
Dottie and Irv glance at each other.
PHYLLIS
I was really shaken up. I called Arnie at work. He said “Are you alright? Then what are you calling me for? I’ve got work to do.”
(shakes her head) We were just married.
The freezer drawer opens and BANGS shut from the kitchen.
FRANCIE (O.S.)
She’s got ice!
DOTTIE
We’ll get a deli tray from A&P. Lillian and Shirley will want to go in on-
PHYLLIS
I don’t have ice.
Dottie sighs and disappears into the kitchen. The freezer drawer opens again.
DOTTIE (O.S.)
Phyll, you got plenty of ice.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - EVENING
Phyllis barrels in. Dottie flinches at the force coming at her. Phyllis seems taller.
PHYLLIS
No! I can’t serve this ice.
DOTTIE
Why not?
PHYLLIS
It’s ugly.
Phyllis digs her hand in and pulls out a handful of cubes.
DOTTIE
Alright. Okay. We’ll get new ice. (writing)
“Pretty” ice.
TIME CUT TO:
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - EVENING
Rabbi Hershfeld and Samuel have joined the group at the table. The Rabbi has a pen and pad out, making notes.
RABBI HERSHFELD
Tell me more about Arnie.
The siblings glare at each other, animosity thick.
RABBI HERSHFELD
(to Phyllis)
What kind of man was he? What kind of husband?
From the kitchen, they hear Dottie’s ironic chuckle before she walks out the sliding side door.
RABBI HERSHFELD
(prompting)
Was he a loving husband?
PHYLLIS
Not particularly.
RABBI HERSHFELD
(shifts in his seat) But he was a kind father?
PHYLLIS
Not really.
SAMUEL
What she means is that my father worked to provide for his family.
SAMUEL (CONT'D)
He was a very responsible man. We grew close in the last couple of years.
FRANCIE
The last couple of years he was a vegetable.
PHYLLIS
Francie!
The argument continues around the bewildered Rabbi.
EXT. ROSE LAWN CEMETERY - MORNING
A cold, grey December morning. A shiny black hearse pulls in through the cemetery gates followed by two black limos and a long line of cars with orange funeral flags on their hoods.
EXT. CHAPEL - MORNING
Everything looks grey in this light.
INT. CHAPEL - MORNING
Robbie slowly walks down the aisle, Cher at his side. Each step seems to take an eternity. Cher glances down, unable to meet the curious gazes of everyone watching.
CHER
(whispers to Robbie) Your shoe’s untied.
(he stops and grins at her) Don’t stop! Jeez won’t get there till Easter.
Robbie chuckles and keeps slowly walking. They finally get to the front row and sit down. The rest of the family join them. Cher looks around.
CHER’S POV OF CONGREGATION BEHIND HER - Dottie winks at
her. In the back are a couple rows of ultra orthodox JEWISH MEN in black hats, beards and black coats. Directly across the aisle from them are Mugsy, Sybil, and Wendy.
Sybil smiles and puts her hand up in silent greeting. Cher shyly puts her hand up in response.
Rabbi Hershfeld steps up to the podium.
RABBI HERSHFELD
Good morning. Today we say good bye to a long-time member of our community.
Arnold Solomon Silver.
RABBI HERSHFELD (CONT'D)
But before I begin my comments, Shmuel Silver, his son, would like to say a few words.
Samuel steps up to the podium.
SAMUEL
My father used to tell me how he took over his father’s business after his death and paid back every penny of debt even though the loans, at that point, were null and void. He was proud of what he built even though he had to give up his dream of being a doctor to do it.
THE SILVER FAMILY ROW - crossed and shaking legs.
SAMUEL
He taught me what it means to be proud of who you are. To be a kind, loving, decent human being. His patience and laughter are the things that I’ll take with me throughout my life.
Dottie looks at Irv in confusion. “Arnie?” Irv shrugs.
SILVER FAMILY ROW - Robbie taps a rhythm into his thigh with his thumb and smiles.
SAMUEL (O.S.)
How does a son say good bye to his father?
ROBBIE
I’m glad he’s dead. I hate him.
A small ripple of murmuring moves through the congregation.
EXT. GRAVE SITE - MORNING
The coffin slowly lowers into the ground as the CANTOR SINGS a haunting MELODY in Hebrew. Under a large green canopy, the congregation sits on wooden folding chairs as the Rabbi finishes the prayer.
RABBI HERSHFELD
Arnold Solomon Silver from the dust you came and to the dust we return you.
Francie sobs. Robbie, in his wheelchair, looks around like a kid. Cher, holds Phyllis’s gloved hand, and finds Sybil’s eyes. Victoria wipes her eyes.
EXT. EDGE OF CEMETERY - MORNING
Samuel, bundled in scarf and hat, stands behind the cemetery fence, watching the proceedings from a distance.
EXT. GRAVE SITE - MORNING
The Rabbi takes a handful of dirt and throws it into the grave. Phyllis gets up and one by one, Cher, Francie and Victoria follow her, throwing dirt into the open grave. As Phyllis tosses the dirt a small JINGLE and a flash of light catches something at her wrist.
ON HER WRIST - A gold bracelet with a heart shaped charm. Cher sees Phyllis touch the bracelet with a far-away look.
SWEEP ACROSS TO:
START FLASHBACK
INT. SILVER HOUSE, CHER AND VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1995
Cher sleeps. The sound of JAZZ MUSIC slowly wafts in and wakes her.
INT. SILVER HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cher sneaks toward the living room, peeks in.
INT. SILVER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Arnie and Phyllis slow dance to DID I REMEMBER. The lyrics waft out: ”Did I remember to tell you I adore you?” He dips her and she laughs a girlish laugh. He leans in and gently kisses her lips. A gold bracelet with a heart shaped charm catches the light, dangles from Phyllis’s wrist.
INT. SILVER HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cher spies, smiling, as the jazz music plays on... END FLASHBACK
EXT. GRAVE SITE - DAY - PRESENT
The group of orthodox men in coats and hats move forward and start shoveling dirt into the grave. Irv whispers to Dottie.
IRV
Where’s Samuel?
Dottie nods at the small black figure at the fence.
DOTTIE
Not an orthodox cemetery.
IRV
What are they doing here?
DOTTIE
Representing him. But they’re not supposed to be doing that.
Phyllis gets a look of fury as the men keep shoveling. She hisses to Cher.
PHYLLIS
I don’t want that grave filled completely in. I said no orthodox ceremony! You tell Rabbi Hershfeld to stop them right now! If your father were here he’d be furious!
Cher stands up and sidles over to Rabbi Hershfeld who looks uncomfortable.
CHER
Rabbi, my mother spoke to you...
RABBI HERSHFELD
(to the diggers)
Thank you gentlemen that will be enough.
They ignore him and keep shoveling. The Rabbi smiles, embarrassed, ineffectual.
CHER
Really? Can you please stop them?
RABBI HERSHFELD
Alright. Thank you.
They keep shoveling.
CHER
Just...
(loses her temper)
My father was NOT a good Jew!
The entire congregation stares at Cher. She shifts uncomfortably.
CHER
Well, he wasn’t really. He was proud of being Jewish, of course...
CHER (CONT'D)
Even though we joined a non-Jewish country club, and lived in a non Jewish neighborhood. He worked hard...as a matter of fact he thought if you were laughing you weren’t working hard enough.
The congregation gape at Cher and her horrible eulogy. Dottie holds her head with the impending train wreck.
Phyllis is furious as she watches the diggers continue. Cher makes a decision and moves towards the shoveling Jews.
CHER
My father didn’t show emotion much. As a matter of fact I have no idea who he was and what he really felt.
Cher reaches the diggers and grabs the lead man’s shovel.
CHER
But I know who he wasn’t.
A small tug of war ensues but Cher’s face is hard as nails. Finally the man gives in. They stop shoveling. Cher returns to her seat with the shovel and hands it to Phyllis, who accepts it with pride.
EXT. CHAPEL - DAY
Cher is in a group hug with Mugsy, Sybil and Wendy.
CHER
Where’s the baby?
WENDY
Home with Mama.
MUGSY
They thought a birth and a funeral in the same week might make him think: ”Why bother?”
They break their sloppy hug. Cher and Sybil look at each other, holding hands.
In the BG, Phyllis, looks over. Her brows furrow.
CHER
I’m sorry.
SYBIL
It’s ok. This is hard stuff.
PHYLLIS (O.S.)
Cher?
Cher breaks instantly, pushing Sybil away so suddenly she almost goes down.
CHER
Mom! These are my friends.
PHYLLIS
(hugs Mugsy)
Oh, Margaret! Did you fly all the way from California?
MUGSY
I’m so sorry, Mrs. S.
PHYLLIS
Thank you. It’s good to see you again.
CHER
And this is Wendy.
Phyllis shakes Wendy’s hand.
WENDY
I’m sorry for your loss.
PHYLLIS
Are you the doctor?
WENDY
Yes.
PHYLLIS
Thank you for what you did for my son. He just started the drugs. The hospice doesn’t know about it of course.
There is an awkward pause. Sybil clears her throat.
CHER
Oh. And this is Sybil.
PHYLLIS
(shakes Sybil’s hand) Cher hasn’t mentioned you.
SYBIL
Cher’s got so many people in her life, it’s hard to keep them all straight.
CHER
We should go home now.
PHYLLIS
Thank you all for coming. Will you be at the house?
MUGSY
Actually we’re heading to the airport.
PHYLLIS
It was good to see you, Margaret. Tell your parents hello.
(to Cher)
Don’t be too long, Cher.
Phyllis walks away. Cher sighs a huge sigh of relief, until she looks at Sybil’s face.
EXT. CHAPEL - MOMENTS LATER
Mugsy smokes furiously, huddled with Wendy.
MUGSY
Oh. She’s kicking dirt. That’s bad.
EXT. CHAPEL, UP THE HILL - DAY
Up the hill, Cher and Sybil argue. Cher digs her toe in the dirt, looking like a naughty child.
SYBIL
I wasn’t even a friend! Just standing there like an idiot!
CHER
I got flustered! I didn’t even know-
SYBIL
Cher. Maybe you really truly don’t want to be in a relationship with me. All the pushing away, the obfuscating, the crap you make people slog through so they don’t get close! It’s got to be exhausting!
CHER
Wait, I-
SYBIL
You were right. You don’t need me.
CHER
It’s just ...my family’s so screwed up-
SYBIL
Your family’s right in front of you. You’re just too dumb to open your eyes.
INT. LIMO - DAY
Cher sits in the back of the limo with Francie, Robbie, Victoria and Norm. Silence.
VICTORIA
Norm, go help my mother to the car.
Norm scowls, but a look from Victoria and he goes. Cher watches as her friends get into a cab. Sybil is the last one in. She doesn’t look back. Cher’s eyes fill as the cab goes.
ROBBIE
(to Francie)
How’s your new apartment? (sarcastic)
Or is that too personal?
Robbie laughs at his own joke, Victoria smiles.
FRANCIE
You think I just ran away don’t you?
Cher wipes her tears and takes on her usual game persona.
CHER
She couldn’t stand the heat.
VICTORIA
Got out of the kitchen.
ROBBIE
Without her fricaseed chicken-
They all snicker.
FRANCIE
Well, you try being the favorite when your father treats everyone else like shit!
Robbie, Cher and Victoria trade nervous glances.
CHER
We were just kidding, Fran.
FRANCIE
(about to break)
It’s not funny. Do you know how much pressure it is to feel guilty because you’re so adored?
CHER/ROBBIE/VICTORIA
No.
Dottie leans into the limo.
DOTTIE
Goddamn that Rabbi. The shortest sermon known to man.
(notices the mood) What. What happened?
INT. SILVER LIVING ROOM - DAY
PEOPLE sit or stand, filling the room. Silver family members are peppered throughout.
Dr. Ron Schwartz holds Francie’s hand and comforts her.
AT THE COUCH - A few orthodox Jewish CHILDREN chase each other past Robbie in his wheelchair.
ROBBIE
Hey!
Two of the YOUNGER GIRLS stop.
ROBBIE
Do you know who I am?
(they shake their heads “no.”) I’m your Uncle Robbie.
Robbie holds out his hand for a handshake. The older of the girls is about to shake his hand...
SAMUEL
Kids! Go help in the kitchen. (to Robbie)
Are they bothering you?
ROBBIE
No.
The girls scamper off. Samuel stands, uncomfortable.
SAMUEL
I’m sorry I haven’t come to visit you in the hospice. I’ve been busy.
(looks away)
I better see what those kids are into.
He walks away.
ROBBIE
Putz.
Francie’s hand on his shoulder brings him around.
FRANCIE
I have a professional question.
ROBBIE
Shoot.
FRANCIE
If someone starts to see things, does that mean they’re crazy?
ROBBIE
Sometimes. But the true definition of insanity is to continue to do the same thing and expect a different result.
Francie frowns at the answer.
A FEW FEET AWAY - Victoria and Norm stand together. She sits down heavily on an ottoman and takes off her shoes, rubbing her feet.
VICTORIA
Why did I wear these?
NORM
They match the dress.
VICTORIA
Tsk. Oh yeah.
Cher looks at her mother surrounded by people, and realizes Phyllis is smiling that smile.
ARNIE’S SAXOPHONE rests on top of the piano. Cher lifts the sax and runs her hands over the gold metal. She turns it and notices the dent in the bell. She shakes her head.
SAMUEL
He loved that thing.
CHER
(shows him the damage) Look what he did to it.
SAMUEL
It still made beautiful music.
CHER
You just can’t tell yourself the truth.
SAMUEL
I’ve held this family together.
CHER
Our father’s anger held this family together. And yours has pulled it apart.
SAMUEL
I protected his right to die as a Jew. As a valued human being.
CHER
Such a good Jew. What about your gay brother?
Samuel walks away. Cher looks around at the state of her family...
CHER’S POV OF HER SIBLINGS
Samuel prays with other orthodox men. Francie sits by herself, reading a prayer book. Robbie sits in his wheelchair, alone, staring at nothing. Victoria has opened the glass cabinet of mementos and inspects a Chinese ivory carving. She turns it over trying to ascertain the value.
INT. SILVER BATHROOM - DAY
Cher gets up from the john and pulls her pants up. As she leans over to flush, something PLUNKS into the water.
CLOSE ON TOILET BOWL - The little Kurukulla sits at the bottom of the bowl smiling up through the pee.
Cher is aghast. She goes to flush but stops. She can’t do it. A huge sigh as she rolls up her shirtsleeve, and plunges her hand into the bowl.
INT. SILVER KITCHEN - 2AM
The kitchen is clean, bare, you’d hardly know there had been a change in this house.
INT. SILVER DINING ROOM - 2AM
Cher and Phyllis sit in their pajamas in silence both sipping tea and eating Oreos. Cher’s Kurukulla charm hangs from her neck outside her pajamas. She twists the two halves of the Oreo apart and scrapes the white filling off with her teeth.
PHYLLIS
Is that how you do it?
CHER
What.
PHYLLIS
You unscrew it?
CHER
Yeah. How do you do it?
Phyllis brings her tea to the chair next to Cher.
PHYLLIS
Let me see this.
(she unscrews her halves) Like that. Then what?
CHER
Eat the white part.
Phyllis scrapes off the white with her teeth. She tastes it and makes a face, then shrugs, maybe it’s not so bad.
PHYLLIS
I guess I have a lot to learn.
CHER
(clears her throat)
Um. While we’re on that subject-
PHYLLIS
The Rabbi did a nice eulogy, don’t you think?
CHER
Yeah. I guess. Um. There’s something I-
PHYLLIS
I hated his tie, though.
They eat Oreos in silence. Cher seems to be fighting with herself over something. Finally...
CHER
Ok. Mom, if we keep doing this I’ll actually never say what I need to and I’ll go back to California and that will be us forever. The Rabbi’s ugly tie-
PHYLLIS
This is about Sybil.
Cher chokes.
PHYLLIS
Cherilyn. You want intimacy. So. Go.
CHER
(wipes her palms on her p.j’s) Um. You probably already know this but Sybil is someone I’ve been... dating.
Cher waits for the bomb to drop. Silence. Her leg starts bouncing under the table.
PHYLLIS
Do you love her?
CHER
(exhales and realizes...) Yes. A lot.
Long pause.
PHYLLIS
Is she Jewish?
CHER
Yes.
PHYLLIS
What does her family do?
CHER
Mom, you’re freakin’ me out!
PHYLLIS
I’m asking what her family does.
CHER
You’re asking me the same questions you would ask anyone.
PHYLLIS
I’m asking my daughter if she’s found a partner that makes her happy. And you know what? Thank God you’re healthy.
They eat and sip their tea in silence again.
CHER
Is this intimacy?
PHYLLIS
Evidently.
CHER
I don’t think so much of it.
PHYLLIS
Yeah, I could take it or leave it. (sips her tea quietly)
Do you think that chair should be in the other corner?
CHER
I wasn’t going to say anything.
They get up and slide the overstuffed chair across the room together. Phyllis sits in the chair and looks sadly around.
PHYLLIS
It should have been more peaceful.
CHER
I know.
EXT. SILVER HOUSE BACK YARD - MORNING
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - THE BACK OF A GRAVESTONE as Phyllis lovingly wipes snow away from the stone.
PHYLLIS
(whispers)
Thank you, God, for giving me awareness and health.
THE SMALL GRAVESTONE READS:
“In loving memory of Panda 1968 - 1983 of natural causes” Phyllis smiles and places a small rock on the headstone. EXT. BEAUMONT HOSPITAL - MORNING
The sun rises and begins to melt the snow on the lawn of the big white hospital
INT. MATERNITY WARD, NURSERY - MORNING
Victoria stands in scrubs and a mask holding one of her babies with wires and IV’s flowing from him. She sighs and watches the baby with happy eyes.
INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING
Francie snaps her seat belt on as people get settled.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Hey! I know you. Did your dad get off ok?
Francie looks up and it’s the same flight attendant as her trip in. She smiles down at Francie.
FRANCIE
Oh-um. Yeah. It was... great.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
That’s good. It’s so nice to have a close family.
The attendant moves down the aisle and Francie smiles her mother’s smile. She pulls out her book and looks at the business card book mark.
CLOSE ON CARD - Dr. Ron Schwartz’s business card. Francie turns it over and looks at the hand written note on the back. “Call me. Ron.”
Francie crumples the business card and stuffs it in the garbage bag as the flight attendant passes around again.
INT. HOSPICE OF THE GOOD ANGELS, HALLWAY - MORNING
Phyllis and Dottie wheel Robbie down the hall. Dottie carries a small suitcase and the electric Chanukah menorah. Sister Michael keeps pace with a disapproving frown.
SISTER MICHAEL
The medicines only put off the inevitable. If it’s God’s plan that-
PHYLLIS
I’ve done God’s plan. Now God can do my plan.
SISTER MICHAEL
But you can’t-
PHYLLIS
Out of my way, Sister!
EXT. HOSPICE OF THE GOOD ANGELS - MORNING
Phyllis and Dottie wheel Robbie out, all three grinning.
PHYLLIS
(giggles)
I’ve always wanted to say that.
DOTTIE
(realizing she’s the sister)
Hey!
EXT. EDGE OF CEMETERY - MORNING
Samuel stares through the fence at his father’s grave. He wipes a tear away for so many things missed.
SHOSHANNA (O.S.)
Shmuel?
Shoshanna steps up and takes Samuel’s arm.
SHOSHANNA
I’m so proud of you. Your father died as God would have him.
(she hugs him) Let’s go home.
They turn and head for the minivan.
EXT. SYBIL’S APT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cher tentatively rings the bell, then knocks the knocker. She nervously twirls a red rose. The door opens and Cher’s smile freezes in place.
A strange woman, LAURA(30), stands there in her pajamas.
LAURA
Hi.
Laura looks at the brave little flower.
LAURA
Pretty.
(calls to Sybil) I think it’s for you.
Sybil comes to the door, also in her pajamas, holding a bowl of popcorn. Laura relinquishes her position, hovering in the BG. Sybil’s face is a mixture of surprise and something else.
SYBIL
When did you get back?
CHER
(sarcastic)
Not soon enough, I guess. (takes a deep breath)
So. What I have to say won’t take very long, I’ll say it and go.
SYBIL
You can come in.
INT. SYBIL’S APT. - NIGHT
Laura stands with arms crossed, watching like a hawk.
SYBIL
Cher, I-
CHER
No. Just let me talk. If I don’t I’ll never get this said. You were right. Feeling scares me. Feeling anything.
Cher’s distracted by the oil painting leaning against the wall. It’s of Cher, Sybil and their friends.
CHER
That’s fantastic.
SYBIL
Thanks.
CHER
(back on point)
Anyway, even though it’s too late-
SYBIL
You don’t-
CHER
Now that I’m willing to venture into the world of adults and actually feel, what I feel is... what I feel is that...
Sybil waits, breath held. Cher can’t say it.
CHER
God. You know what? My father damaged the things he loved most. And that’s what I do. I love you. I would have rather blown my brains out than hurt you. And by not admitting my feelings I hurt you anyway and... I’m sorry.
(almost in tears)
Well. There. I made it real.
She turns to go.
SYBIL
Cher, wait.
(motions for Laura)
Laura? I guess you figured this is Cher. Cher this is my sister, Laura.
Cher turns, thunderstruck, embarrassed. Laura grins at her.
CHER
I, um,... I didn’t recognize you from your pictures.
LAURA
I go blind when I panic too. It’s cool. (to Sybil)
Do you guys mind if I leave you alone for a few? It’s way too intense in here.
Laura disappears into the bedroom, leaving them alone.
SYBIL
(at the rose) Is that for me?
CHER
Oh.
(hands the rose to Sybil)
Yeah.
SYBIL
This is the first time you’ve ever brought me...
(looks at the single rose) Flower.
(beat)
Did you mean what you said?
CHER
What.
SYBIL
About blowing your brains out.
Cher looks at her helplessly.
SYBIL
Just checking for something I can hold against you later.
Sybil smiles, reaches in and grabs Cher. They kiss a long passionate kiss. When they break, Cher can’t catch her breath, hyperventilates.
SYBIL
Oh, Honey. Did I do that?
CHER
(gasping for breath)
Don’t... flatter yourself... stress.
SYBIL
Do you have any idea how much I adore your neurotic little butt?
(laughs and hugs Cher close) Anyway your brains are much too cute to be splattered all over the pavement.
Cher nods, still hyperventilating. Sybil takes on a familiar “Silver” dead pan tone.
SYBIL
But it would give a whole new meaning to the words “street smart.”
Cher’s breath CATCHES in her surprise to hear the Silver word game from Sybil. It calms her. She takes on the “game tone.”
CHER
No doubt my brains would land in the express lane. For a quick getaway.
SYBIL
No. That’s the self express lane. And you’re gonna find out what that’s for.
CHER
Oh, really?
SYBIL
Yeah, really.
CHER
I suppose you think you’re the driver?
SYBIL
I’m the master driver, baby.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
DISSOLVE TO:
A hand hangs out the fourth floor window with a cigarette.
INT. CHER AND SYBIL’S NEW APARTMENT - NIGHT
Mugsy smokes out the window. The huge room is lit with candles.
MUGSY
Woo! Woo! Listen to that echo.
The sound of a baby crying fills the room.
MUGSY (O.S.)
Ohh. See? Now that hurts my ears.
Sybil and Cher, Wendy and Lisa shushing the BABY, sit in the middle of the room around a casual floor picnic. On the wall behind them, Sybil’s oil painting of the friends, and just below it Arnie’s saxophone on a stand, no other furniture. Mugsy tamps out her cigarette and joins them.
MUGSY
What the hell are you guys gonna do to fill this place?
Cher sighs deeply and takes Sybil’s hand.
CHER
Love each other.
MUGSY
(to the others)
I think I liked the old Cher better.
LISA
Clinically, you know, Cher’s grown.
WENDY
Yeah, she gave up rent control.
CHER
Don’t remind me.
SYBIL
We’ll just call this our grand experiment. And barring that, we could always keep jumping up and down to avoid the impact.
Cher looks at her friends.
CHER
You know I love you guys-
MUGSY
Oh my god, if you say it again I’m gonna have to kill something with my bare hands.
(beat)
Hey. Wanna know what I did today?
WENDY
What.
MUGSY
Got a porn star out of her contract.
CHER
We’re so proud.
EXT. CHER AND SYBIL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
The sounds of our friends continues out over the city.
FADE OUT:
A silent video plays. This time our new family of Cher, Mugsy, Sybil, and Wendy, try to make a doomed pyramid.
Mugsy playfully gives the camera the “finger.” The video suddenly dissolves to SCRATCHY VIDEO like the Silver family home movies in the beginning.
The baby walks unsteady steps to Cher and she cheers him on with the Mr. Rabbit puppet.
Cher and Sybil hold hands, deep in conversation at the table when they notice the camera. Cher “walks” Mr. Rabbit into the camera closer and closer until it goes black.
THE END
