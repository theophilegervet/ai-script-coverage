CLOSE ON RUNNING SHOES
CRUNCHING RHYTHMICALLY over a dirt path. PULL UP to reveal
EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT
An OLD WOMAN chugging along, POWER-WALKING with a fanny pack around her waist and tiny pink weights in hand. Her EXHALES puff out into the winter air.
There's no one else out at this hour, let alone exercising.
The Old Woman rounds a corner and stops, catching her breath. Pushed herself a little too hard. She's in front of a DARK TUNNEL under a bridge, and beyond it we can catch a glimpse of the WASHINGTON, D.C SKYLINE.
She collects herself, and is about to resume when a WHIMPERING noise catches her ear.
She looks around. Hears it again, and glances towards the tunnel.
She takes a few cautious steps towards it. A LARGE PUDDLE comes into view, right under the bridge.
Another WHIMPER, and something disrupts the placid water, sending little RIPPLES towards the woman's shoes.
She squints into the darkness, trying to make out what's there.
Takes a few more steps, and comes face-to-face with a GOSLING
On the other side of the puddle, struggling to lap up the water. It sees her and skitters away into the darkness.
ON THE OLD WOMAN
Smiling at this tiny encounter with mother nature. She turns around to go, just as...
A MAN FALLS from the bridge above and SLAMS head-first into the pavement in front of her.
The Old Woman jumps back, the weights falling from her hands and SPLASHING into the puddle. She stands frozen in panic.
She fumbles with the zipper of her fanny pack, struggling to pull out a CELL PHONE as she begins running back down the path as fast as she can.
CLOSE ON THE MAN'S FACE
As blood pools on the pavement around his head.
His neck is broken, spinal column jutting out from his skin, as he STARES RIGHT AT US.
MATCH CUT TO:
A WOMAN'S FACE
Staring listlessly. This is SAM MASSEY, early 30's, overworked and underslept.
As we PULL BACK, we can see she's working on a laptop and that we're in...
INT. FDA OFFICE - DAY
Beige, fluorescent, ordinary...this ain't google. Sam frowns at something on her screen.
CELINE'S CUBICLE - DAY
Sam knocks on the wall and TAMIRA swivels around.
TAMIRA
Hey, what's up?
SAM
Did you see the 483 Meerabelle drafted for Dexatecrin?
TAMIRA
No, why?
Sam looks both ways to make sure no one's listening.
TAMIRA (CONT’D)
Uh oh. You want me to have her rewrite it, or...?
SAM
No no, I'll punch it up. It just makes me nervous about the Pfizer audit next week.
TAMIRA
(scolding) Saaammnmm...
SAM
No, I'm just --
TAMIRA
I told you, we'll be totally / fine.
SAM
I know -- but maybe I can find a way to skype in? Or at least contribute remotely...?
TAMIRA
You could, but then it kind of defeats the purpose of, ya know, vacation. Right?
Sam stares at her shoes.
TAMIRA (CONT’D)
Sam, you're the best. You've worked here like six years and taken, what, two days off?
SAM
Are you saying I'm married to my work?
TAMIRA
Your words...
SAM
Then at least one of my marriages worked out.
She meant it as a half-hearted joke, but it totally sucks the air out of the room. Tamira averts her eyes.
TAMIRA
Anyway... You should go have fun. And I promise I'll let you know if the building's on fire.
Sam nods begrudgingly.
SAM
You're right. No, you're totally right.
She starts to walk away.
TAMIRA
Where are you going again?
SAM
This um...
(scratches her head)
...wellness retreat?
TAMIRA
Wait really??
SAM
Yeah, but it's not...my friend went last year, and... I would never normally go, but with everything this last year...
TAMIRA
Yeah, no of course.
SAM
It's just five days. And it seems like it could be...yeah.
TAMIRA
You know, I've heard those can be
life-changing.
Off Sam's conflicted look --
EXT. D.C. STREET - NIGHT
Snow falls into the tiny cracks between zig-zagging pedestrians.
Sam navigates it, she and the other commuters bouncing off each other's puffy coats like bumper cars.
INT. METRO TRAIN - NIGHT
Sam grips a handrail, stuffed between fellow sardines as she struggles to read a book.
INT. CUBAN TAKEOUT SHOP - NIGHT
Sam walks up to the CASHIER.
SAM
Hi, um --
CASHIER
Cubano with rice and beans to-go?
Sam blushes and nods.
EXT. CUBAN TAKEOUT SHOP - NIGHT
Sam walks out with a takeout bag, and heads down a street running parallel to a park.
BRIT (O.S.)
Sam?
She looks up at BRIT, 40’s and wearing glasses.
SAM
(taken aback) Brit. Hey.
They both think about hugging, but neither do.
SAM (CONT’D)
How are you?
Brit shrugs, difficult to put into words.
BRIT
I come walk here sometimes. I don’t know.
They both glance over at the park, and we can see it's the same one from the opening.
BRIT (CONT’D)
How about you? What have you been...?
SAM
Just...you know.
BRIT
Yeah.
(beat)
You know, my parents would... We all miss you.
Sam nods, growing uncomfortable.
BRIT (CONT’D)
I don't know how it works with like, staying in touch with your in-laws after...
Yeah.
SAM
BRIT
But if you ever... I don't know, maybe we could get together sometime? If you wanted.
SAM
Yeah, no I'd love that.
They share pained smiles. Clear to both that they won’t be seeing each other.
INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The remnants of a once-cute place are barely visible underneath the layers of takeout boxes, stray clothes, unopened mail, and wilting bouquets -- only some of which are in vases.
Sam sets her food down and rummages in the fridge for hot sauce. She closes the door, putting her face-to-face with a
PHOTO BOOTH STRIP
Three stills of her and DEVIN, the man who fell in the park. They’re cute bride-and-groom wedding photos, with funny hats and sunglasses and wigs.
Sam takes in the photos. Like they've frozen her in place...until an EERIE SINGING in the room makes her jump.
She surveys the room and realizes it’s her phone. Grabs it from her purse and sees: “Madison would like FaceTime...”
Sam slides to answer, and video appears of MADISON. She’s the same age as Sam, but you’d be forgiven for thinking she’s her kid sister. It’s not just that Madison looks younger (she does), it’s that she radiates an energy and vitality that render Sam a little, let’s be honest, frumpy.
She’s even radiant three thousand miles away on a phone screen.
Hey girl!
MADISON
SAM
Hey! Where are you?
Madison’s in a stunning, stylish dress surrounded by dozens of loud people in some kind of warehouse.
MADISON
At a shoot, this new rum by Drake.
She swivels the phone around and we can see PHOTOGRAPHERS, CREW PEOPLE, and lots of bright lights. The room’s set up for a staged party, replete with a golden bar and a DJ.
SAM
Is that in LA?
MADISON
Toronto, I’m back in the morning before you get in.
SAM
Honestly, what is your life?
Madison laughs and spins in a circle.
SAM (CONT’D)
Like remember a year ago when you were ready to quit and become a barista?
MADISON
I know, I’m so lucky. (correcting)
Not lucky. I’ve been working hard and deserve it. Have you packed yet/tttt?
SAM
Yessssss, obviously.
She glances at a VERY UNPACKED SUITCASE next to her bed.
MADISON
I am like, beyond excited. Are you so excited?
SAM
I am. I definitely am. But I’m kinda...
What?
MADISON
SAM
...maybe not sure if I can go?
MADISON
(instant concern) What happened?
SAM
Nothing, no, just... Work’s crazy, they really don’t want me to take time off...
MADISON
But you didn’t even take time off after Devin.
SAM
I know, but...
MADISON
Let me talk to them. That is
ridiculous.
SAM
No, it’s fine, it’s also... I don’t know, isn’t it just going to be a bunch of LA, like, hippy goopy woo woo...?
MADISON
(scandalized) Oh my god...
SAM
Am I wrong?
MADISON
You’re getting cold feet on me!!
SAM
No I’m not, I promise...
While Madison talks, Sam grabs an ORANGE PILL BOTTLE from the counter and throws a couple back. We can see “antidepressant” on the label.
MADISON
Ok first of all, yes, it’s kinda..."Angelino-y." I get it. But dude, a) it’s out in the middle-of- nowhere Arizona, not Brentwood, and
b) you asked me if you could come...
SAM
I know.
MADISON
...and like, I’m not saying I pulled a huge once-in-a-lifetime favor to get Willa to let you come...but I’m not not saying that.
SAM
Yeah, no, and I so appreciate it.
VOICE OFFSCREEN (V.O.)
Madison? We gotta...
MADISON
(to Offscreen Voice) Yeah one sec.
(back to Sam)
Ok listen: I know you think you don’t deserve this. And we’re gonna work on that, that’s part of the whole point. But in the meantime, you need to hang up, and send your questionnaire to Willa if you haven’t already, and get on that fucking plane in the morning. Your life like literally depends on it. Okay?
Sam smiles. Then squints at her phone.
SAM
Is that a panther?
Madison looks behind her, at what is indeed a PANTHER lying on a leather couch.
MADISON
Yeah that’s Freya, wanna say hi? She is the cutest --
VOICE OFFSCREEN
Mads...
MADISON
Gotta go -- see you tomorrow!
The CALL ENDS. The apartment's plunged back into silence.
Sam gazes at the fridge. Reaches out and slides the photo strip over to the side wall, where it's out of sight.
LIVING ROOM
Sam plops onto the couch and turns on the TV. It’s not loud enough to drown the silence, but at least gives that comforting hum.
She grabs her LAPTOP and opens it. Clicks over to an existing tab, which we see is the WEBSITE FOR EVEXIA.
It's a simple and elegant site: the centerpiece is a PHOTO of the back of a person's head, facing a group of women seated in a circle.
Below the photo, the words: “Loving Within to Love Without. By invite only.”
Sam admires the women in the photo. Their faces are so serene and compelling. So empowered.
She clicks over to an open WORD DOC. It's a questionnaire, and as she scrolls through it we see she's filled in most of the answers. Except the last one, which she stops at:
“How do you hope to transform at Evexia?” Off Sam considering it...
CUT TO:
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - THE NEXT DAY
A MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE kicks up dust on the open road.
The highway cuts through a great American expanse of brush and cacti, red rock mountains in the distance.
INT. CONVERTIBLE - DAY
Sam takes it all in while Madison drives.
SAM
I can’t believe you rented this!
MADISON
Life is short, betch. Have you ever seen a desert so beautiful?
Sam shakes her head, soaking in the grandeur around them. A SONIC DRIVE-IN appears in the distance.
SAM
Hey, can we stop?
Madison follows her look.
MADISON
Oh no -- Sam...
SAM
Come onnnnn.
MADISON
Girl we’re here to de-toxify.
SAM
Exactly, so please let me have a last meal? I’m gonna die...
MADISON
You’re not gonna --
SAM
Please please --
MADISON
The food is good there!
SAM
Oh I’m sure.
Madison glares at her.
SAM (CONT’D)
I thought life is short...betch.
Madison grins and JERKS the car off the highway.
EXT. SONIC DRIVE-IN - DAY
They sit parked in the mostly-empty lot, feasting on burgers and fries.
MADISON
Oh my god, this is so disgusting yet so good.
SAM
(sipping a shake) Right?
Madison holds up something covered in various sauces.
MADISON
What am I even looking at here?
SAM
Chili cheese tater tot.
Madison makes an ew face, so Sam lunges and bites it out of her hand. They both crack up.
MADISON
You’re insane. This is making me think of our cram-crams at Waffle House?
SAM
OhMyGod yes, crammin' for finals...
BOTH
...n crammin' our faces!
MADISON
Such a throwback. Like who would ever eat this shit now?
Madison reaches into her purse, while Sam’s chewing slows. She kinda maybe does still eat this shit.
MADISON (CONT’D)
We must document.
Madison pulls her phone out and records a video.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Hey guys! Ok, so what’s the best way to prep for a week of wellness?
She pans down to their burger binge, then back up at her making a cute frowny face.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Oops! But you’ve gotta indulge every once in a while...right girl?
She turns to Sam, who peers up at their faces on camera.
SAM
Obviously.
MADISON
This is Sam, BFF since college days
-- Tar Heels, bitch! Ok gotta go treat ourselves to some more greasy goodness, byyyyeee/eeeeeee.
SAM
Byyeeeeee.
They wave at the phone, as a PAIR OF BLOODY HANDS grab the windowsill behind them.
They both SCREAM and whip around to see A DISHEVELED WOMAN
Pulling herself up the passenger door from the asphalt. Her hair is a wild mess, her skin's soaked in sweat and dirt with patches of scabs, and her eyes squint rabidly under the sun.
MADISON
He-- Hello?
Sam crawls back towards Madison.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Are you okay?
The woman scratches at her hair and throat as she climbs into the car.
SAM
We should call 9-1-1.
The woman lunges at them as if to say no.
SAM (CONT’D)
MADISON
Whoaaa.
Madison shields Sam.
Ok, ma’am?
MADISON (CONT’D)
We want to help you, but you need to tell us what’s wrong, ok? Can you just tell us --
The woman opens her mouth at Madison, showing that her TONGUE HAS BEEN SEVERED. Recent stitches line the back of her throat, and she strains to speak but nothing comes out.
Fuck.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Oh my god.
SAM
The woman pleads with Sam with her eyes. Crawls closer and closer until --
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey!
Sam and Madison whip around to see A SONIC WORKER
Jogging up holding a food tray.
SONIC WORKER
Totally forgot your Pretzel Twist.
He reaches the car and holds out the tray for them. Sam and Madison look around, and the woman is gone.
EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY
Madison drives them around a curvy ravine.
MADISON
I don't see her anywhere, do you?
SAM
No. Should we go back and look more, or...?
MADISON
I don't know, she didn't really seem like she wanted to be found. I assume she just wanted money?
SAM
Yeah, I guess so.
Madison sighs and shakes her head.
MADISON
The saddest part is she probably didn't have health insurance.
SAM
What do you mean?
MADISON
That tongue amputation? Like she could've been a totally normal middle-class, whatever, person, but one sickness and boom, now she's homeless.
SAM
Oh, you think that's what it was?
MADISON
I mean that's what they do for mouth cancer, right? Why else would her tongue be gone?
SAM
True.
MADISON
Fucking western medicine, man.
Sam sits back in her seat, nodding but unsettled, as they pull onto a DIRT ROAD.
MADISON (CONT’D)
(sing-song) We maaaade iiiit!
They pass under a sign, with hand-crafted letters that spell out “EVEXIA”.
The sign's adorned with flowers and totems hanging from string that CHIME in the wind, and beyond it we can see a small village of tents and huts amidst an old ranch property.
TITLE ON BLACK:
DAY ONE:
GATHERING
EXT. EVEXIA HOUSE - DAY
Sam and Madison walk up from their car, which is parked alongside a few others, and carry their bags towards the little beat-up wooden ranch house.
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - DAY
They walk in to find three other women there with their bags: HEDDY, LIZA, and JESSICA.
On the inside this place is, simply put, lush. You can feel your pulse drop as you take it in: the soothing music, the comfy chairs and sofas, the plants and succulents. It's all southwest chic decor.
NENITA (O.S.)
Sam?
Sam turns to find NENITA standing in front of her. She's a stunning Filipino woman, 22 years-old at most, and she's wearing a LAVENDER JUMPSUIT.
SAM
Yeah?
NENITA
I'm Nenita, I'll be your personal wellness consultant during your stay.
Oh. Hi.
SAM
NENITA
Can I take your bag?
SAM
Um, sure.
Nentia takes it across the room with the other bags, as Heddy sidles up to Sam.
HEDDY
She's mine too.
Heddy is stocky with short hair, wearing jeans and an open cardigan.
HEDDY (CONT’D)
I guess I shouldn't say "mine," that sounds pretty fucked up.
SAM
(half-laugh)
I was just thinking that.
HEDDY
It's like cruise ship vibes -- you ever been on one of those?
Sam shakes her head no.
HEDDY (CONT’D)
I played one years ago in the Carribbean, whole staff was kind of noticeably from poorer backgrounds. It felt weird, man.
SAM
Played, like music?
HEDDY
Stand-up.
(before Sam can react) I know, dregs of the earth.
Another woman in a lavender jumpsuit, KITTY, has taken Madison's bag. She's white and also early 20's, and aside from some marks on her face and a couple dead teeth that give her a former-meth-head vibe, she's also exceptionally beautiful.
She turns and addresses the room:
KITTY
(southern accent)
Ok hi y'all! A few of the others are here already and some are arriving later, but we're gonna show you around real quick and get y'all to your rooms. So just follow me!
She leads them to the back of the ranch house, where instead of a wall, a giant sliding glass door has been installed. It opens up to a STUNNING DESERT COURTYARD.
As they go, Madison leans over to Sam.
MADISON
You don't know who that is?
SAM
Who?
MADISON
The woman you were just talking to. That's Heddy Moore.
Sam shrugs like "Sorry?" and Madison rolls her eyes. Heddy walks past them and Madison touches her arm.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Heddy, hi, I'm Madison. I loved
your Netflix special.
HEDDY
Aw, thanks.
(to Sam)
And I didn't catch your name?
SAM
Oh sorry -- Sam.
HEDDY
Cool to meet you.
They shake hands as they walk out to...
EXT. EVEXIA COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Where for the first time we're offered a full view of the estate. Scattered OLD RANCH FIXTURES and modern-looking TENTS AND YURTS nestled amongst the brush and cacti, and beyond it all, an incredible view of the ARIZONA DESERT.
KITTY
Welcome to Evexia. This is the main courtyard, where we'll gather for meals and morning meditation. Down there to your right you'll see the treatment center...
Sam looks down the hill at a small wooden structure.
KITTY (CONT’D)
The Sound Dome is beyond that ridge to the left there, and that's also where you'll find the garden.
Everything you'll eat this week is grown there.
JESSICA
Where's the bar?
Everyone chuckles as Jessica runs a pale hand through her shoulder-length black hair. She's wearing a thousand dollar silk button-up and black skirt that scream Manhattan lawyer, which is exactly what she is.
Nenita places a hand on her shoulder.
NENITA
I know that's a joke, but as you know, there's no alcohol or drugs allowed during the week.
Jessica flashes a smile -- not really a smile, but one of those squint-your-face to force it into a shape that vaguely resembles a smile because you know you have to in this social situation.
HEDDY
I've seen some of the foods we're going to eat, those don't count as drugs?
MADISON
It's definitely hard at first, but by day three you'll feel incredible. I promise.
LIZA
It's true, I've been before too. You won't even be thinking about wine or meat.
HEDDY
How many pounds of kale you want to bet on that?
They smirk at each other -- Liza's disgustingly thin with long blonde hair, and covered in jewelry and beads. Crunchy California Joni Mitchell vibes.
KITTY
Let's continue.
EXT. YURT VILLAGE - DAY
Nenita and Kitty lead the group to a row of eight yurts arranged in a perfect semi-circle around a fire pit.
KITTY
Ok, now the hardest part...
NENITA
Devices out, please.
The group all dig out their phones, tablets, and laptops from their bags, as Kitty walks around holding an open trunk to place them in.
Kitty stops in front of Sam, who's swiping on her phone.
SAM
Just checking one little work --
...Can you come back to me last?
Kitty stands waiting. Sam reluctantly powers off her phone and drops it into the trunk. Kitty smiles at her.
INT. SAM'S YURT - DAY
Nenita shows Sam into her room, which on the inside looks like a five-star hotel: oil diffuser, chic lanterns, plush comforter, yoga mat neatly rolled up against the wall... It's like a mini-suite.
Nenita sets her bag down.
NENITA
Is everything to your liking?
Sam nods, overwhelmed by the luxuriousness.
NENITA (CONT’D)
We're glad you're here, Sam. If you need anything at all during your stay, just ask.
SAM
Ok.
NENITA
And...I'm sorry for your loss.
Sam looks over at her. How did she...?
NENITA (CONT’D)
Tomorrow we'll talk over your treatment plan.
Nenita smiles and leaves, closing the door behind her.
Sam crawls onto the bed and takes in the quiet room a moment. The gorgeous quiet. Just the sound of the desert wind softly whistling by.
She looks out her window, and in the yurt next to her can see a REDHEADED WOMAN. She's gripping her pillow in both hands and biting into it as she appears to scream.
Sam looks away, embarrassed for seeing.
But the curiosity gets the best of her, and she peeks back out -- and now the Redhead is glaring right at her.
Sam's startled. Quickly looks away and scoots down her bed so her head's out of view.
She stares up at the ceiling, and takes in a DEEP BREATH.
EXT. PATH FROM YURT VILLAGE - NIGHT
Sam climbs up the path towards Evexia House. As she gets closer, we can see the courtyard LIT UP for the night.
EXT. EVEXIA COURTYARD - NIGHT
Sam takes in the scene: strung lanterns and candles, air thick with incense, and in the center of the space a CIRCLE OF PILLOWS atop a fluffy sheepskin rug.
A few of the women are already seated chatting with each other, including Heddy, Liza, and Jessica from before; and Sam's Redhead neighbor as well.
Sam hesitantly goes to sit near her.
SAM
Hey, um...
EVA
Oh hi! I'm Eva!
EVA extends a hand, and it's like she's a whole different person now. Perfectly poised, and immaculately put together. Sam shakes her hand, confused.
SAM
Sam. Hey I'm sorry about earlier...
Eva cocks her head like she's confused.
SAM (CONT’D)
I, um, didn't know our windows were so close.
EVA
(relentlessly cheerful)
Oh, don't even mention it! I'm just glad we're going to be neighbors.
She flashes a bright smile and returns to the others.
AUBREY, short bangs and chic TORTOISESHELL GLASSES, acknowledges Sam with a deadpan SMOKER'S RASP.
AUBREY
We're debating which social media we'll miss most.
SAM
Ah.
AUBREY
So far Instagram and Snapchat are top contenders.
Madison joins them...
MADISON
Definitely Instagram for me. But I
love the break from it.
AUBREY
No man, Twitter. Staying away from the news is like heroin withdrawal.
EVA
Same.
AUBREY
(to Sam) How about you?
SAM
Oh my god, I don't know. Is it terrible if I say my work Slack chat?
ALL
Ewww / Oh my god!! / No way!!!
AUBREY
No I get that. It's a real love/hate relationship, especially in D.C.
SAM
Oh, you're in D.C. too?
AUBREY
(nodding)
And even worse, I'm a political consultant. What do you do there?
SAM
I'm a consumer safety officer. For the FDA.
Oh.
AUBREY
(feigning enthusiasm)
They all nod, politely unimpressed.
TORI (O.S.)
Honestly?
They look over at TORI, a tall and slender Asian-American woman who's been quiet till now.
TORI (CONT’D)
Tinder.
She raises a water glass and the group laughs.
A STRING OF BELLS RING behind them, and the group of eight women -- now all assembled -- turn to look.
Nenita and Kitty emerge from the house, followed by two other women in matching lavender jumpsuits: ANA SOFIA (Latinx), and RAZAN (Syrian-American). We'll be referring to these four women as the LAVENDERS.
They're all carrying plates of food with gold coverings, and set them on the floor in front of each attendee.
Nenita lifts the covering from Sam's plate, revealing a beautifully garnished...SINGLE STEM OF KALE. It's curled around a zucchini blossom, atop a gumball-sized dollop of lentils.
Heddy looks up at Razan.
HEDDY
(very subdued and serious) Excuse me, this is far too much.
Liza snorts and playfully smacks Heddy's arm, making the jewelry on Liza's wrist JINGLE. They're starting to bond.
Sam looks around her plate -- no silverware.
JESSICA
How the fuck are we supposed to eat this?
The women exchange confused looks, until Madison smiles and scoops up some lentils and kale with her fingers.
EVA
Oh, we're doing that kind of rustic?
Eva enthusiastically follows suit. The others reluctantly do the same.
Sam takes a bite and her face lights up.
SAM
Oh, it's really good.
AUBREY
Mm. It's so fucking fresh, isn't it?
Very.
HEDDY
Very.
LIZA
Heddy and Liza laugh at each other.
LIZA (CONT’D)
Jinx, bitch.
Jessica sits back and looks at her instantly-clean plate.
JESSICA
I don't know, not really enough for it to actually taste like anything.
A few of the women scoff in agreement.
WILLA (O.S.)
Practice gratitude, my sisters.
All the women turn, startled to see WILLA standing at the doorway. How long has she been there?
Willa appears to be in her 40's, but it's hard to say because the aura she gives off makes it hard to focus on anything else in the entire universe.
She's in a gauzy white summer dress, with long flowing hair and a gaze that could penetrate cinder block.
She smiles at the attendees, making meaningful eye contact with each of them.
WILLA (CONT’D)
I'm so thrilled you're here for this journey.
Willa joins the pillow circle, crossing her bare feet.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Each of you has come for a different reason. But you're all linked by the same vibration, the one that brought you to Evexia.
Sam glances around the circle -- some are nodding intently, others unsure like her.
WILLA (CONT’D)
These next five days are going to challenge you. At times you'll feel euphoric; at other times you may feel uncomfortable. But I promise that if you commit fully, by the fifth and final night you will not just be your best selves -- you will be new selves.
A hope fills Sam's eyes. She leans forward in her seat.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Nenita?
Nenita and the other Lavenders come back in with trays of SMALL GLASSES, and set one in front of each guest.
WILLA (CONT’D)
You've already met our Lavender sisters: Nenita, Kitty, Razan, and Ana Sofia.
(MORE)
WILLA (CONT’D)
Their work here is invaluable to the magic we create. We honor them.
Willa bows her head at the Lavenders, who return the gesture, then step back to the side of the room.
WILLA (CONT’D)
A toast.
Willa raises her glass, full of a MILKY WHITE TONIC. The others follow suit.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Not tequila...
The group CHUCKLES.
WILLA (CONT’D)
But an invigorating tonic with that all-natural kind of kick.
(smiles)
To the realignment of our minds, our spirits, and our bodies. So that our beautiful insides match our beautiful outsides.
They all clink their glasses.
Sam and Madison share a smile and private cheers across the circle, before Sam throws her drink back. She wipes the tasty remnants from her lips.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Alright my sisters, enjoy the rest of the night. Because tomorrow we begin.
She smiles, as UPTEMPO MUSIC COMES IN that takes us to...
EXT. EVEXIA COURTYARD - NIGHT SERIES OF SHOTS:
-- The women form a makeshift a dance party under the desert sky.
-- Madison, throwing her body around totally carefree, drags Sam off her feet to get her to join.
-- Heddy swivels a chunk of CRYSTAL back and forth in front of a lantern, creating a homemade disco ball effect. Liza shakes her head at her, smiling flirtatiously.
-- They take turns picking songs on the CD player and singing into a pretend mic like it's karaoke.
-- Jessica and Tori lie in a hammock, in deep conversation.
-- Sam dances more wildly, starting to let loose.
EXT. PATH TO YURT VILLAGE - LATER
Sam ambles home, giddy and light-footed, as the lights and sounds of the party continue behind her.
She sees Madison across the way, on the path leading the opposite direction.
Sam's about to call out, but then notices Willa there too. Willa's hands are on Madison's shoulders, rubbing them consolingly while speaking with her as Madison nods.
Willa kisses her on the forehead and they hug tightly. Sam observes them a moment. Decides to continue on...
INT. SAM'S YURT - NIGHT
Sam closes the door behind her. Doesn't bother with the lights, just immediately flops onto the bed. That comfy, fluffy, vacation-y bed.
She rolls onto her stomach and flips open her suitcase. Rummages through it until she finds her orange prescription bottle.
She unscrews the lid and shakes it out over her palm...but nothing comes out.
She looks into the bottle -- yep, totally empty.
SAM
What the...
She searches through her suitcase to make sure, flipping up clothes, running shoes, etc.
She sits back on her bed. Smiles in shock like, Really? Even Zoloft is contraband?!
Then something catches Sam's eye. Across the dark room, she spots a SHADOWY FIGURE crouched in the corner -- DEVIN'S EYES staring right at her. Staring just like he was with his neck broken in the park.
Sam GASPS and scoots back against her headboard. Reaches for the reading lamp next to her bed and FLIPS THE SWITCH.
She glances back, and it's just a WOVEN HAMPER in the corner. Sam squints at it. That was weird.
Then her stomach LURCHES -- a sudden ache. She rubs her hand over it. Takes a deep breath.
She gets out of bed, and starts to head for the bathroom when suddenly her ABS CONSTRICT and she doubles over. Nearly falls to the floor, as she clutches her gut in pain.
She opens her mouth like she's trying to scream but all her face muscles have flexed at once. She's frozen like this, writhing silently, unable to breathe, until finally...
She VOMITS something up.
Sam takes in a huge inhale, like she's just emerged from underwater.
She peers down at the floor, at the puddle of OPAQUE PALE BLUE LIQUID surrounding the MASS OF SOMETHING she's just thrown up.
What the fuck is it?
She looks closer: the color is unnatural, almost silken in texture. But it appears to be a chunk of the SONIC BURGER she ate earlier.
As Sam examines it, the chunk begins pulsing. Like it has a heartbeat.
Thump-thump. Thump-thump.
The beat grows louder as the meat writhes and twists. It begins to resemble something closer to a baby animal, covered in amniotic fluids and trying to break free...
Sam stares at it in shock. Thump-thump. THUMP-THUMP --
TITLE ON BLACK:
DAY TWO:
PURGING
INT. SAM'S YURT - THE NEXT MORNING
The heartbeat transforms into a KNOCK-KNOCK at the door, and wakes Sam up.
She sits up in bed. Surveys the room...no mess on the floor.
Was that just a dream? Another KNOCK-KNOCK.
SAM
Come in.
Her door CREAKS OPEN and Nenita pokes her head in.
NENITA
Good morning.
Sam looks at the PITCH BLACK SKY behind her.
SAM
Is it...morning?
NENITA
How did you sleep?
SAM
(thinks a beat) Yeah. Okay.
NENITA
Willa has requested the group's presence for a sunrise hike.
SAM
And when you say "requested"...
NENITA
Everything at Evexia is a choice.
Nenita smiles at her, in a way that suggests the correct
choice.
Off Sam deciphering her look --
EXT. DESERT CANYON - DAWN
Sam and the other women follow Willa up a red rock path, the purple sky giving way to those first orange rays.
They're moving fast, Willa not even breaking a sweat, and the other women keep pace with differing degrees of effort.
Tori and her tall lanky body are fit, lifting water bottles as weights while she walks. Heddy, meanwhile, lags behind and is already out of breath.
HEDDY
Remind me when we eat again?
WILLA
(calling back)
Top of the canyon, Heddy! You don't want to miss the morning view from there.
Heddy stares up at the intimidating CANYON FACE before them.
The four Lavenders follow behind the group, wearing backpacks full of supplies.
Sam's near the middle of the pack, working up a sweat but feeling good.
Madison slows to join her.
MADISON
(sing-songy) Morrrrnin' sunshine.
SAM
How dare you.
MADISON
How'd you like last night?
SAM
It was great, that was so fun. (beat)
I did...feel a little weird after.
MADISON
Oh really? Weird how?
SAM
Yeah, just...got a little sick. I don't know if I spaced out or whatever, but my antidepressants are gone. And I got a refill right before I left, so... I don't know, do you think they would've like, confiscated that?
MADISON
Maybe. But you're probably not going to need those anymore, right? I mean I don't use any chemical shit now.
SAM
Really?
Sam nods.
MADISON
Fuck no. We put way too much trust in doctors, we treat them like gods. Like that homeless woman we saw at Sonic -- how'd it turn out for her?
MADISON (CONT’D)
But if you start feeling bad, just tell Willa, I'm sure she'll take care of it.
SAM
Yeah. Totally. No, I'm not worried about it.
Madison throws her arm around Sam.
MADISON
Look at that sky!!!
She runs ahead to the front of the group. Sam shakes her head at her friend -- always the group cheerleader.
Heddy catches up with Sam.
HEDDY
Hey, I overheard you. Just so you know, I got sick last night too.
SAM
You did?
HEDDY
Horrifying diarrhea. The kind where it sprays like a loose hose.
She blows a wet disgusting raspberry.
SAM
OhMyGod stop, please stop!
HEDDY
I think it's those little tonics she gave us.
SAM
I wondered that too, if they're like a cleansing...whatever...
HEDDY
Exactly. But I am here to lose a few pounds, so...I guess shitting out all your organs is one way to do it.
They continue on.
Up ahead, Sam sees Eva come to a stop on the side of the path. She's facing away, but we can see her hands on her ribs and her red hair bouncing with each short breath.
SAM
Hey, you ok?
Eva mutters unintelligibly. Sam lays a hand on her shoulder.
SAM (CONT’D)
Do you need any...?
Eva spins around. The veins on her face are BULGING, and her eyes have rolled back in her head.
SAM (CONT’D)
Hey guys!
Eva collapses onto Sam, taking them both to the ground.
SAM (CONT’D)
Help! We need help here!
The others stop and rush over, crowding over them. Willa slips through and crouches near Eva.
Sam scoots back to give them space. She can hear Willa WHISPERING something to Eva.
It's hard to see because Willa's long hair covers both their faces, but she then takes a VIAL from her pocket, and holds it up for Eva. The vial is clear glass, with a little metal pendant dangling from the cork.
Willa uncorks it and helps Eva drink the BROWN LIQUID inside. This all happens fast, and out of view of the others.
MADISON
Let's give her some space.
The group scoots back a bit, as Eva comes to. Blinks her eyes a few times, and stumbles to her feet.
She shakes out her red hair, suddenly energized like nothing happened.
EVA
Ok, let's keep going ladies!
Willa stands as the women APPLAUD and continue on.
SAM
Are you sure you're ok? You looked pretty bad there.
Eva turns to her -- eyes now glassy and grey, like something has changed deep within her -- and smiles brightly.
EVA
I feel great!
Eva laughs and runs to catch up with the group. Sam and Heddy exchange a confused look.
HEDDY
I'll...have...what she's...having?
EXT. RED ROCK SUMMIT - SUNRISE
The women sit in a semicircle around Willa, looking much like the picture from the Evexia website. The sun has begun its ascent, making the sandstone glow like a jack-o-lantern and shooting stunning orange rays over Willa's shoulder as she speaks to them before this magnificent view.
WILLA
Worth the early hike, right ladies?
MUMBLES of agreement, as the Lavenders walk around offering snacks. Sam holds her hands out expectantly...and looks down at the SINGLE ALMOND that's been placed in her palm.
WILLA (CONT’D)
I want you all, in a single word, to tell us why you're here.
She looks to Madison, seated directly to her left. Madison smiles, relishing the prompt.
MADISON
Epiphany.
She looks to Aubrey, who fidgets with her glasses.
AUBREY
Um. Release.
And so on...
EVA
Preparation.
TORI
De-stressing.
HEDDY
Fat.
The group laughs. Heddy turns to Sam, who thinks a beat...
SAM
Grief.
She feels a few eyes on her. Turns to Liza...
LIZA
Balance.
Sobriety.
JESSICA
Willa nods at the group, smiling.
WILLA
Thank you. When I was a little girl, my mother died. Complications from labor. So my father raised me
-- but when I was in college, he developed early onset dementia. It was...not fun to watch. I dropped out of school, and took care of him...and for some reason, he started to ask me over and over again, "What's my obituary?" Like a record on loop, "What's my obituary? What's my obituary?" I realized I didn't know how to answer. Father? Loving husband?
Always showed up to work on time?
She pauses a beat. Closes her eyes, drinking in the sun.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Close your eyes.
They all do. The circle has grown quiet.
WILLA (CONT’D)
I want you to imagine your death. Imagine one of these hawks diving from the sky, and ripping out your heart. Your life force being gone in a single instant.
Sam sneaks her eyes open. This is kind of uncomfortable. Glances at the other women, but sees their eyes are still closed, and so closes hers too.
WILLA (CONT’D)
What will your obituary say? Will it read: "Mediocre woman?" "Answered her emails quickly?" Or will it say, "Wherever she went, she radiated life. Heads turned in her presence. She was powerful and beautiful and her life was always a memorable celebration."
SAM'S POV
Darkness mixed with flickering orbs of light.
WILLA (V.O.)
As you think about why you're here, those words you spoke out loud...let your mind broaden around them. What will it take for you to finally seize your own power? What are you blaming yourself for, that's been in your way?
The balls of light in Sam's vision turn into small, BEADY EYES. The loose shape of a head forms around them, swirling like a cloud, and this mysterious face is STARING RIGHT AT HER.
Sam snaps her eyes back open, breathing heavily. Willa notices. She silently gets to her feet.
WILLA
Keep breathing...
As the others continue meditating, Willa kneels next to Sam and wraps an arm around her.
WILLA (CONT’D)
(whispered)
I'm watching the blood course through your veins. You're dealing with a terrible darkness, but we're going to turn that pain into power.
Sam nods, eyes brimming with tears. BIRDSEYE VIEW
Of the semicircle in silent meditation. The only other sound a SOFT BREEZE, as a HAWK glides through frame.
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - DAY
The women return, sweaty and out of breath. They walk up to the breakfast table...to find only a ROW OF TONICS set out.
Jessica picks one up, flipping her black hair out of her face.
JESSICA
Is this breakfast?
Kitty smiles curtly. Heddy turns to Sam and imitates it.
EXT. EVEXIA COURTYARD - DAY
Sam walks out with her tonic to find Eva on a pillow.
SAM
Can I join you?
EVA
Sam sits.
Of course!
SAM
Are you feeling alright?
(on Eva's confused look) When you...fainted earlier.
EVA
Oh, that? No, totally fine. I've always gotten lightheaded really easily.
SAM
I don't know, it was a pretty long hike to do on an empty stomach.
EVA
Well I'm definitely used to that part, I barely eat at home. No, I really feel amazing.
SAM
Where's home?
EVA
Berkeley.
(obligatory)
I do -- I work with a lot of social causes. Environment, animal rights.
SAM
Cool.
EVA
Yeah. I love it. But my mom --
She stops herself short.
SAM
What?
EVA
No. Nothing. Just... Well she's in government, and she's trying to get me to run, so...I'm kinda here to suss that out.
SAM
Oh, gotcha. I think Aubrey said she's in politics too, in D.C.   ?
EVA
(uninterested)
Mm. Aren't you as well?
SAM
Oh, yeah, no. I'm just a bureaucrat, nothing fancy.
EVA
(trying to be sweet)
I'm surprised you were able to afford something like this.
Sam's taken aback.
SAM
(diplomatically)
I... A friend helped me out.
Eva nods, barely concealing judgment. Sam notices her leg shaking.
SAM (CONT’D)
Hey, you know, my stomach's been hurting, so...I'm probably not going to finish this.
She offers her tonic glass.
Eva looks up at Sam. We can get a better look at her eyes now, glassy and grey like before.
She takes the glass and gulps it like a steak dinner.
EVA
(quietly) Thanks.
Sam nods. About to get up, when:
EVA (CONT’D)
Hey um... Up on the mountain. You said you're here because of grief. Do you mind me asking...?
SAM
No, it's okay. Last year my husband took his life.
Eva's face softens.
SAM (CONT’D)
But it's -- I'm okay. It sounds worse than it... I'm just glad to get away for a while.
Eva nods, sort of stunned into silence. She takes Sam's hand into hers.
EVA
I'm sorry.
Off Sam's look --
EXT. PATH TO TREATMENT CENTER - DAY
Sam walks in a single-file line with Heddy, Jessica, and Eva.
They pass a large circular structure -- the sound dome Kitty pointed out earlier. It has a small opening to the sky up top, and GLOWS RED from within.
As they pass by, Sam sees the other attendees following Willa into the dome.
INT. TREATMENT CENTER - DAY
The building is a converted old stable house. The common area, where they are now, has been treated with rugs and couches like a spa lobby, with the same desert decor.
Jessica is standing naked on a body composition monitor in the middle of the room, the others watching in bathrobes.
Razan finishes writing down measurements -- weight, BMI, visceral fat, skeletal muscle, etc. -- then nods to Jessica that she can step down.
Razan turn to Sam. Sam hesitates, then slips her robe off and steps onto the scale.
INT. TREATMENT CENTER - LATER
AERIAL VIEW of four stables, converted into SPA ROOMS, where each of the four women are lying on tables receiving different treatments.
Ana Sofia (the skin specialist) and Razan (the massage and physical therapist) move between the rooms tending to them.
SAM'S SPA ROOM
Sam's lying under a sheet while Ana Sofia rubs a BLUE GEL over her face.
ANA SOFIA
Are you relaxed?
SAM
(nodding)
And a little hungry.
Ana Sofia smiles.
ANA SOFIA
Good for your metabolism.
She finishes with the gel and cleans her hands off with a towel.
ANA SOFIA (CONT’D)
The gel's a numbing agent so you won't feel.
SAM
Feel what?
BUZZ. Sam looks over to see Ana Sofia's now holding a MICRONEEDLING DERMAROLLER -- a small electric roller covered in tiny needles.
She holds it over Sam's face and begins running it over her skin in even strokes. Small dots of blood form.
Sam closes her eyes, trying to relax.
SAM (CONT’D)
Have you worked here long?
ANA SOFIA
No. The Retreat only happens once a year, so we're seasonal employees.
SAM
Oh.
ANA SOFIA
Try not to move too much.
Sam glances down to see the BUZZING NEEDLES passing over her cheek, churning up blood.
SAM
How did you meet Willa?
ANA SOFIA
(a beat) The internet.
SAM
Oh. And are you a...beautician back home, or...?
ANA SOFIA
Not really.
Sam waits for her to say more, but she doesn't.
SAM
How about the tonics, and all these spa products? Are they all different existing brands, or do you guys make them --
The roller abruptly PRICKS SAM right near the eye, beyond the analgesic goo. She winces.
SAM (CONT’D)
Fuck!
Ana Sofia jerks the roller back and turns it off.
ANA SOFIA
I'm so sorry. My hand must have slipped.
Sam touches her face. Feels the blood millimeters from her eyelid.
SAM
It's fine.
Ana Sofia grabs a tissue and gently dabs at it.
ANA SOFIA
It's really best if you don't speak.
She picks the roller back up and turns it back on. BUZZZZZ --
INT. TREATMENT CENTER - COMMON ROOM - DAY
Sam sits on the couch in her robe, sipping a cup of water. Her face is red and blotchy all over.
We PULL BACK to see Jessica sitting next to her, her black hair and fair East Coast skin drenched in SWEAT.
JESSICA
(without looking at her) What was yours.
SAM
Microneedles. You?
JESSICA
Infrared sauna. They said I have an unusually high number of toxins.
Probably related to that bottle of Makers in my desk.
Sam nods slowly, barely wanting to move.
SAM
I think mine's just cause I have bad skin.
Heddy walks out from her stable, limping slightly. Stands there a beat.
HEDDY
She...exfoliated...my vulva.
She stares at them, traumatized...as Sam and Jessica bust into LAUGHTER.
EXT. PATH FROM TREATMENT CENTER - DAY
Sam trudges up the path under the afternoon sun. She stops a moment and soaks it in. She feels beat up, yes, but isn't that a great feeling sometimes?
A VIBRATION sound makes her open her eyes. She scans the brush around her and spots something...
Inspects it closer, and realizes it's a RATTLESNAKE writhing in the dirt. It twists and contorts, RATTLING like it's either angry or in pain.
Its tail bulges and gapes...and then a TINY NEWBORN slips out. Then another. The two babies WRIGGLE on the ground.
Off Sam, simultaneously mesmerized and unsettled --
EXT. EVEXIA COURTYARD - DAY
Sam comes up from the path to find Heddy and Kitty arguing, as some of the others watch.
HEDDY
There was nothing on the website about fasting!
KITTY
Some components --
HEDDY
I read the whole thing!
KITTY
Hon I understand...
Sam notices yet another row of TONICS have been set out.
KITTY (CONT’D)
I'm just telling you that some components of the program are intentionally withheld --
HEDDY
Oh great, what else is being withheld? Sleep deprivation tonight? Clit chopping at sunrise?
Liza touches her arm.
LIZA
Heddy, I know you're joking, but --
HEDDY
I'm not joking! You think I'm joking? I came here to lose a few pounds and feel better about myself
-- if anyone had said something about zero food after climbing a mountain, I never --
TORI
Ok it was like, not a "mountain."
HEDDY
What are you a fucking Sherpa?!
TORI
You're being a little dramatic.
HEDDY
Fuck this...
She turns to walk away, bumping right into WILLA. Where did she come from?
WILLA
Is there a problem?
HEDDY
Yeah um, small problem Willa: I'm fine with the exercise, I'm fine with the diet, I'm even fine with my vag being sanded like a two-by- four -- but you kind of neglected to tell us that the path to wellness included secret starvation tactics.
WILLA
You're upset at today's absence of traditional sustenance.
HEDDY
Food, as most people call it -- which we haven't had since last night, and that was a single leaf!!
WILLA
I can assure you that our tonics are giving you the exact nutrients your body needs.
HEDDY
Then how come my arm's been twitching since this morning, and Eva looks like Gandhi?
EVA
(weakly)
I really feel ok!
WILLA
Heddy, your entire being is detoxifying. Side effects are absolutely normal and to be --
HEDDY
Ok but then why didn't you tell us that in advance, so we'd --
WILLA
(sharp)
Because not everything is for you to know.
Heddy falls quiet. Willa maintains her poise.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Like I said this morning, some of this week may feel uncomfortable. But that is necessary to help you overcome what you perceive as boundaries. If I had told you about a sunrise hike in advance, would you have participated? If you'd had the space to conceptualize it?
(off Heddy's silence) Everything at Evexia is a choice. I'll never force you to do anything
-- but all of you are here to unleash new parts of yourselves, and to do that you need to trust my process.
Heddy considers her, unsure.
HEDDY
Are we going to have real food tomorrow?
Willa goes to her. Lays a hand on her cheek.
WILLA
You have a beautiful, joyful spirit. Instead, ask yourself why you don't consider this food real.
Off Sam watching --
CUT TO:
A SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS:
-- A wooden stick stirring GREEN PASTE.
-- The paste being rubbed onto Sam's neck, chest, legs, etc.
-- Strips of SEAWEED being wrapped around her body
-- PLASTIC WRAP being wrapped over the seaweed
-- A large sheet of FOIL being unfurled
EXT. GARDEN - SUNSET
Next to the Evexia garden, which boasts a stunning bounty of vegetables and herbs, sits a little WHITE BEDOUIN TENT.
Between the flaps, we can see Sam lying on a table, bundled up like a mummy as Ana Sofia finishes securing the last bit of foil over her seaweed body wrap.
INT. BEDOUIN TENT - CONTINUOUS
Ana Sofia gently slides an EYE MASK over Sam's face, and sets an egg timer. She steps out of the tent, lowering the flaps as she goes.
SAM'S POV
Obscured by the eye mask, except for a sliver of vision at the bottom.
ON SAM
Inhaling slowly. Then exhaling. Trying to relax after the arduous day.
She hears a RUSTLING SOUND, like a nearby animal. SAM'S POV
Trying to see between the tent flaps, which are gently swaying in the breeze.
She can make out a little of the garden, glowing in the golden hour light.
Suddenly, a figure DARTS THROUGH her field of vision. Sam tries to sit up, but her body's completely immobile. She lies back. Tries to ignore it.
But then the RUSTLING SOUND again.
Sam wiggles within her wrap, trying to shift the eye mask so she can see more. She manages to nudge it up a bit, widening the sliver, and looks down to see...
Nothing. Just the serene garden.
She keeps looking, straining her neck...then starts to lie down again, just as...
There's CACKLING LAUGHTER. Right outside the tent. Like frenzied giggling, but thick from the inclusion of something phlegmy.
Sam squints at the tent flaps around her. Trying to locate the source of the sound. She looks back down to see
RAZAN AND ANA SOFIA
Huddled together in the garden, in crazed laughter as BLACK AND RED FROTH dribbles down their chins.
Sam lets out a soft GASP that makes them WHIP THEIR HEADS TOWARDS HER. Their teeth and gums are all black and red.
Sam lies back, breathing fast. Hoping they didn't notice her. The tent's quiet now. Just the soft breeze.
The silence gets to her, and Sam glances back down... Razan and Sofia are gone.
But one of the TENT FLAPS is open.
Right as she notices it, the RUSTLING NOISE comes back inside the tent, louder now. She struggles against the wrap, can hear it on the floor and behind her head. Like insects skittering towards her.
She arches her back, trying to squeeze one of her shoulders out of the plastic wrap.
CLOSE ON SAM'S EYE MASK
Being lifted by something unseen, just as... DING!
Sam's eyes open. And ANOTHER ANGLE reveals she's now in:
INT. SAM'S YURT - NIGHT
Sam's standing in front of the mirror. She takes in the room... How did I get here?
She turns back at her REFLECTION. The redness on her face has started to subside, but as she inspects it closer she can see a few SMALL BUMPS forming. Like nascent little zits.
A KNOCK at the door startles her. She glances towards it...
MADISON (PRE-LAP)
Ok tell me everything..
INT. SAM'S YURT - MOMENTS LATER
Sam and Madison sit on the bed.
MADISON
...How were your treatments?
SAM
Well...I feel like I've been put through an industrial washing machine...
MADISON
(laughing) Accurate.
SAM
And no, um... It's been amazing. I really loved the hike.
MADISON
Mmm.
SAM
It made me want to start running again. But I've still been kind of...out of it? Like, losing track of time, and...seeing things.
MADISON
What kind of things?
SAM
Devin. Memories of him, and...
She seems like she's about to say more, then shakes her head.
MADISON
That's weird, I didn't experience anything like that last year. I mean I got a little vomit-y, but no visions. Do you think it's from being off the meds?
SAM
Maybe? But it's only been a couple days.
MADISON
I mean it makes sense with everything your body and mind are processing right now, you know? And this is all really new for you.
SAM
Yeah, I'm sure it's just that. (changing the subject)
What was your day like?
MADISON
Oh my god...
She lies back on the bed.
MADISON (CONT’D)
Willa led us in this Tibetan sound bath that was fucking mind-blowing. I had a revelation that I need to switch agents and start making films.
Really?
SAM
MADISONN
(nodding)
I realized I should be using my platform to promote, like, this. I'm in a position to raise so much consciousness, and actually help people. Like you.
She takes Sam's hands in her own and cradles them.
MADISON
I know what a weight you've been feeling. I can't even imagine... I mean what happened with Devin was just, so unexpected...so out of the blue...
Sam stares at their hands, averting her eyes...
MADISON (CONT’D)
It must be so overwhelming. And maybe that's why you're seeing visions, maybe your system's just purging all that shit, once and for all. You know? Like maybe it's a good thing?
INT. SAM'S YURT - LATER
Sam asleep in bed. The cut should feel jarring.
A very quiet WHISPER emanates from somewhere close. Not in her head, but very much in the room with her. Like it's coming from the closet or beneath the bed.
Another WHISPER, and Sam blinks her eyes open.
BATHROOM
Sam laps up some water from the tap. Examines her reflection in the MIRROR again.
Decides to look closer at the little BUMPS on her forehead. Half a dozen of them now. She raises a finger to one, about to poke at it, then looks up and sees DEVIN watching her from the shadows of her bedroom.
She whips around. The room is empty. Sam takes a short breath, calming her senses.
But then outside her yurt an ANIMAL SHRIEKS. She lifts her head towards the sound.
EXT. SAM'S YURT - NIGHT
The door slowly CREAKS open, and Sam pokes her head out. Stillness.
She steps out onto the porch, wrapping her arms over her chest in face of the cold desert night air.
Another SHRIEK, coming from somewhere behind their houses. She walks over to side of her yurt, and looks out at the BLACK DESERT beyond.
EXT. DESERT BRUSH - NIGHT
Sam cautiously follows a red dirt path that leads from Yurt Village. The terrain becomes surprisingly forest-like, the cacti interspersed with TALLER TREES and WILDFLOWERS. A small CREEK BUBBLES nearby.
As she goes, she notices SMALL STONES carefully stacked on top of each other, little formations someone has delicately constructed.
Suddenly another SHRIEK, a yowling that sounds otherworldly now that it's so close. Its proximity sends Sam to the ground, crouching behind a felled tree.
She waits there, eyes darting in every direction. Scared, but wanting to find out what this is.
Her eyes land on something obscured through the thicket of trees.
HEDDY, kneeling by the bank of the creek, hunched over a PARTIALLY DISEMBOWELED COYOTE.
The coyote lets out another HOWL as Heddy leans over and rips a BITE OF FLESH from its stomach. Her face and forearms are covered in blood and guts.
In her horror, Sam accidentally knocks over a stack of rocks. Heddy's face SNAPS UP -- teeth bared, seeming to stare right at us.
Pregnant silence.
Suddenly Heddy CHARGES towards Sam, on all fours like an animal.
Sam frantically scoots back, trying to get to her feet.
Heddy SPLASHES across the creek, when suddenly WILLA appears, blocking her path.
Heddy freezes. Confused and frightened. Willa looks down at her. Eyes calm but determined.
Willa takes from her nightgown a GLASS VIAL, the same one she gave Eva, and uncorks it. Holds it over Heddy's mouth and waits for her to open up, then helps her drink it all down.
Sam watches in confusion as Heddy sits there in the water, subdued now, as Willa walks over to the coyote.
Willa goes to her knees and cradles the bloody animal in her arms, and as the coyote lets out a comforted WHIMPER, Willa grabs hold of its head and BREAKS ITS NECK.
INT. SAM'S YURT - MORNING
Sam GASPS and jolts up in bed. TITLE ON BLACK:
DAY THREE:
COMMUNING
EXT. DESERT - SUNRISE
The sun rises over the desert, bright red and harsh.
INT. SAM'S YURT - SUNRISE
Sam sits in the edge of the bed. Taking in the morning light and trying to process: How did I get back home? Was any of that fucking real?
She notices her left leg is nervously bouncing up and down. She glances over her shoulder at a pile of CLOTHES AND SHOES on the ground.
EXT. SAM'S YURT - SUNRISE
CLOSE ON Sam tying up the laces on a pair of RUNNING SHOES.
EXT. DESERT - SUNRISE
Following SAM ON A RUN. Soaking up the morning sun. Hoping it melts away these impurities. Hoping it brings some clarity.
She relishes it the way you do when it's been awhile.
She comes to a stop. Catches her breathe as she takes in the view -- the SANDY LANDSCAPE reaching as far as the eye can see. In the daylight, there's comfort in the expanse.
She spots an old dilapidated WOODEN STRUCTURE in the distance. Nestled against a hillside, roof caving in and beams missing from one side. These old ranch fixtures possess a beauty in their decrepitude, and Sam admires it a moment.
She turns around to head back, and for a moment her VISION BLURS. Just a little lag, like after being on a merry-go- round -- or when you're starving and fatigued.
She looks around, but can't see the Evexia compound anywhere.
Wait, which direction did I come from?
She turns a few times, then her vision clears and the main house comes into focus a few miles away. It was there all along.
Sam gathers herself a moment, before starting to head back --
INT. SAM'S YURT - MORNING
Sam walks back in to find her bed has been made, with fresh towels sitting atop the comforter.
She picks up one of the towels, revealing a BANANA hiding underneath.
She picks it up. Looks out the window, as a little smile creeps onto her face...
EXT. EVEXIA COURTYARD - DAY
The full group of women are assembled with Willa on the floor, watching Jessica and Liza do a roleplay exercise.
LIZA
(as Jessica's dad)
What do I make you feel? Come on, you can say it.
Jessica glances at Willa, like do I really have to do this. Willa nods in encouragement.
JESSICA
You make me feel pressure, Dad.
LIZA
(as Jessica's dad) What kind of pressure?
Jessica sighs.
LIZA (CONT’D)
(as Jessica's dad) Come on, look at me. Hey.
Jessica looks back up at her.
JESSICA
To be successful, and beautiful, and happy. And somehow the 'happy' part pisses me off the most. Like it's not okay for me to ever be a little fucking miserable sometimes
-- which, I'm sorry, but I am.
LIZA
(as Jessica's dad) Honey, I don't want you to be anything other than you.
JESSICA
Yes you do. You wanted me to go to Princeton, you wanted me to be a lawyer like you, you wanted me to get engaged to Rick Price. So I did all those things -- and that's what made me start coping by drinking too much.
LIZA
(as Jessica's dad) Jessica --
JESSICA
...But then the drinking makes me feel guilty, so I bury myself in work to drown it out. And then all that work stresses me out, so I drink more to calm down. And it cycles, and cycles, and that's how I end up with three DUI's, Dad.
Because I'm trying so hard to be fucking HAPPY for you.
Jessica resists the tears that have formed. Liza steps towards her.
LIZA
(as Jessica's dad) Here's the honest truth, hon:
Miserable, sad, happy, mad... That's what makes you you. My daughter. And you is what I love.
Jessica breaks down, fully sobbing now, as Liza takes her into her arms. The group APPLAUDS.
Tori stands up, tears in her eyes, and hugs Jessica as well.
TORI
I'm so proud of you.
Sam leans over to Heddy.
SAM
Didn't realize we signed up for acting class...
She waits for a sarcastic reply...but Heddy seems moved.
HEDDY
That was beautiful.
Sam looks over at her, and sees that Heddy's eyes are GLASSY AND GREY. Just like Eva's were yesterday.
Willa turns to the group.
WILLA
Thank you, Jessica. Shame -- We all carry so much of it, don't we?
The women nod in agreement. Willa surveys each of them, making deep and intentional eye contact.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Sam.
Sam looks up nervously.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Why don't you come up?
Sam hesitantly rises to her feet and goes to the front.
SAM
Um. Ok. So as some of you know, I lost my husband recently. He went for a walk at the park near our house and...jumped. So I'm here because I want to...rediscover who I am. Or discover who I am now? And I want to learn how to take care of myself again.
WILLA
Let's start that by reconnecting you to him. What was your husband's name?
SAM
Devin. But I don't really...
WILLA
Aubrey, will you channel Devin for us?
Aubrey stands and joins Sam.
SAM
Are you sure, um...
WILLA
Trust me, Sam.
She nods to Aubrey, who takes her glasses off to get into character.
AUBREY
(as Devin) Hi baby.
Sam averts her eyes, instantly uncomfortable.
AUBREY (CONT’D)
(as Devin)
I miss you so much.
SAM
(sharp) No you don't.
AUBREY
(as Devin)
Of course I do. Why wouldn't I? You're my beautiful bride.
Sam breaks from her, turning to the group.
SAM
Ok I just -- Sorry, but Devin wouldn't say that.
WILLA
Why?
Because --
SAM
She stops herself short.
AUBREY
It's ok.
SAM
Because towards the end...there wasn't a lot of love between us.
WILLA
Why?
SAM
Last year, we got pregnant. And... (heavy sigh)
And then I miscarried.
Her eyes flicker towards Madison, who's visibly surprised.
SAM (CONT’D)
And I know he thought it was my fault. So.
She shrugs.
WILLA
Thank you for sharing that. Aubrey, let's continue the exercise with that in mind.
Aubrey nods, prepares to resume the roleplay. Looks up at Sam with a resentful look.
AUBREY
(as Devin) I hate you.
SAM
Whoa. What are --
AUBREY
(as Devin)
I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!
SAM
Stop it!
AUBREY
(as Devin, in her face) YOU KILLED HER!!
Sam bolts through the circle, nearly stepping on them as she goes.
Madison rushes to her feet, but Willa motions for her to stay put.
Willa turns and watches Sam, hurrying away from the courtyard...
INT. SAM'S YURT - DAY
Sam closes the door behind her. Like she's keeping out a monster.
She strides to the bathroom mirror. Looks at the bumps on her face, which have now sprouted yellow/grey tips. She angrily squeezes on one until it BURSTS.
She begins POPPING them one-by-one, filling the mirror with yellow/grey splatter that drips with oatmeal-like consistency
-- again, like zits but something eerily off about them.
She finishes and stands there. Small reclaiming of control.
The FRONT DOOR KNOB turns. Sam whips her head towards it as...
NENITA comes in. She startles when she sees Sam.
NENITA
Oh I'm sorry -- I thought you'd be at...
SAM
Sorry. I came back early.
NENITA
Is everything alright?
Sam lingers in the bathroom doorway, zit pus visible on the mirror behind her.
SAM
I don't think I'm doing this right.
Nenita steps in and closes the door behind her.
NENITA
It's hard before it's easy.
SAM
(nodding)
And I knew it would be, but... It just seems like I'm not enjoying this the way everyone else is.
Nenita nods in understanding.
NENITA
When I first moved to the States, I had a hard time with the language. I would get so frustrated.
(MORE)
NENITA (CONT’D)
Then one day my son said, "Remember, Mom, a smile can be understood in any language." Which is kind of like saying...fake it till you make it.
Nenita smiles. Sam weakly reciprocates.
SAM
How old is your son?
Something in Nenita's look shifts.
NENITA
Six.
SAM
It must be so hard to be away from him like this.
Nenita nervously smoothes out her lavender jumpsuit.
NENITA
I shouldn't have mentioned him.
SAM
Why? I like to hear about --
NENITA
No. They're very strict with the rules here.
She looks Sam dead in the eye. Like there's much more to say, but that this isn't the place to say it.
NENITA (CONT’D)
Please don't tell anyone.
SAM
I won't.
An awkward silence.
NENITA
(changing the subject) Now...if you want to try something new...that might help you let you guard down...?
SAM
Please, anything...
NENITA
There's a solo treatment, so you can be by yourself... Willa says it's excellent for reducing anxiety and clearing the mind.
SAM
That sounds great. What is it?
INT. TREATMENT CENTER - DAY
Sam's in a robe with thick booties and glasses, looking up at a cylindrical CRYOTHERAPY CHAMBER. Its sleek silver exterior glistens under the light as Nenita moves it into place.
SAM
How cold does it get?
NENITA
About 180 degrees below zero.
SAM
(bracing herself) Okay.
Sam steps into the chamber.
NENITA
The cold is good for your joints, and lowers your heart rate.
SAM
How long does it go for?
NENITA
Three minutes. You don't want to be in there any longer.
SAM
No I do not.
Nenita holds her hand out expectantly. Sam disrobes, and hands her clothes to her.
Nenita closes the chamber door.
Sam inspects the walls surrounding her. A LURCH startles her, but it's just the platform she's on moving up, so that her head peeks out from the top of the chamber walls.
Sam adjusts her goggles as Nenita sets things up on the touchscreen.
Nenita pauses, realizing something.
NENITA
Oh... You probably thought I meant Fahrenheit.
SAM
It's minus-180 Celsius? What is that in Fahrenheit?
NENITA
Minus-300.
Sam's face falls.
NENITA (CONT’D)
Do you want to get out?
Sam thinks.
SAM
It reduces anxiety, right?
Nenita nods. Sam nods back at her to continue.
Nenita presses a BUTTON on the touchscreen and the chamber HUMS to life. Blue lights illuminate Sam inside, the only light in the room now.
Sam observes the chamber filling up with thick freezing GAS. It makes her unable to see
A PAIR OF BARE FEET
Walking into the room. They stop behind Nenita.
SAM (CONT’D)
This isn't too bad.
Nenita feels a tap on her shoulder. She looks back at the person who's just walked into the room, who leans forward and WHISPERS into Nenita's ear. They're silhouetted by the blue glow.
Nenita nods and leaves the room. The other person turns towards Sam, whose face is becoming obscured by the gas.
SAM (CONT’D)
Whoa, there it is. Ok yeah that's cold.
The figure takes a couple slow steps towards her.
SAM (CONT’D)
What kind of gas is it?
No response. Sam glances over the rim of the chamber, but can't see through the fog.
SAM (CONT’D)
Hello?
WILLA
It's better when you let go, Sam.
SAM
(taken aback) Where'd Nenita go?
WILLA
I want to pick up where we left off. Because you seemed hesitant to be fully open.
SAM
You want to talk now?
WILLA
Tell me more about why Devin chose death, Sam.
SAM
I've been trying not to dwell on that.
WILLA
That's part of the problem. We can't release something until we identify it, see it clearly, and then embrace it.
SAM
Well the truth is I don't know why.
WILLA
You said before that you think it had to do with your miscarriage.
SAM
Maybe.
WILLA
Tell me how it happened.
SAM
Willa, I'd prefer not to talk about this right now.
She pushes against the chamber door, but it won't open.
WILLA
Go ahead.
Sam shifts, TEETH CHATTERING. Sees no other option.
SAM
It was awful.
She touches a hand to the chamber wall, to keep her balance.
SAM (CONT’D)
He wanted children more than me. I didn't even... So when I got pregnant, I wanted to go to work like normal. And go for runs like normal. But then...
QUICK FLASH: Sam in an upscale restaurant bathroom. She stands from the toilet, and when she turns back to flush is startled by the sight of a BLOODY PULPY MESS.
BACK TO SCENE
SAM (CONT’D)
I want to get out.
WILLA
What happened after?
SAM
Willa...
WILLA
Stay with me, Sam.
SAM
He wouldn't look at me. We'd talk, we'd carry on like everything was normal...but he never really looked at me again.
WILLA
It made you feel guilty.
SAM
So guilty.
Why?
WILLA
SAM
He made me feel like I had caused it. Even though everyone told me it could have happened to anyone.
A tear falls down her cheek, and instantly freezes.
SAM (CONT’D)
Hasn't it been three minutes?
WILLA
What happened next?
Sam BANGS on the chamber wall.
SAM
Let me out!
She tries to climb over the rim, but her arms are weak and she falls back to the floor.
Willa stands serenely.
WILLA
He wouldn't look at you. So what did you do?
Sam wraps her arms around her shaking body.
SAM
Nothing. I didn't do anything. I didn't try, because I never try. So months went by...and it was terrible. Finally I couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to fix it so badly.
WILLA
Good. More.
SAM
So I left work early, and bought a bunch of groceries and candles, and made us dinner. All our favorite things. And he came home from work, and saw it set up, and...
She hesitates.
WILLA
And what?
SAM
And he just stood there. And he said, "You don't get it. It can't ever be like it was." And then he put his coat on and walked out...and never came home.
QUICK FLASH
Devin on the ledge of the park bridge...falling forward... BACK TO SCENE
Sam falls against the chamber wall, face turning blue.
WILLA
How does that make you feel?
SAM
(near whisper) Please let me out.
She slides to the floor.
WILLA
You need to face this. He chose death over life; he chose death over you, Sam... How does that make you feel?
Sam sits there, engulfed in the freezing fog.
SAM
Worthless. Like I always feared.
She's about to pass out when CLICK -- the chamber shuts off and the DOOR OPENS.
Sam falls through the open doorway, lying there naked and icy as she catches her breath.
She looks up, and through the rapidly dissipating fog, sees that no one is in the room with her.
EXT. TREATMENT CENTER - SUNSET
Sam staggers out, robe thrown back on, and BUMPS into Madison.
MADISON
There you are, I've been looking -- (seeing her face and lips)
Holy shit. Are you okay?
Sam breaks down and falls into Madison. Madison holds her.
SAM
(between sobs)
We have to -- There's something wrong here. Willa...everyone who... I want to leave.
MADISON
What?
SAM
I want to leave. Please take me home.
MADISON
Sam, what happened?
Madison pulls back to examine her. Can instantly see Sam's traumatized.
Sam nods.
MADISON (CONT’D)
It's okay. You don't have to tell me, whatever it is...it's okay. We can um... Of course we can go. Let me explain to them, and we'll leave in the morning, okay? First thing when we get up.
MADISON (CONT’D)
And you can come stay at my place, and take as much time as you need. We'll do our own little retreat there. We can talk, not talk...whatever.
SAM
Ok.
Madison pulls her back in close.
MADISON
I love you.
SAM
I love you too.
Sam takes a deep breath.
MADISON
You alright?
Sam nods.
MADISON (CONT’D)
I'll go talk to them right now. It's going to be fine. Do you feel okay getting back to your house?
SAM
Yeah. I'm ok.
Madison touches Sam's face once more, a concerned look in her eye, and goes.
Sam stands there a moment, waiting for her body to warm up.
Something catches her eye through the Treatment Center doorway. She takes a step back and peers in.
In the corner of the shadowy entrance room, on the floor, is a TRUNK. The trunk they put their devices in on the first day.
Off Sam considering it --
INT. SAM'S YURT - NIGHT
Sam gets into bed and pulls the covers over her head, creating a little blanket fort.
Inside, she turns on her CELL PHONE. Types "Willa Evexia retreat" into the search engine. Nothing comes up, not even the retreat website.
She tries different combinations. Just Willa's name -- nothing. Just Evexia -- a Greek translation website that explains "English translation: wellness."
Sam hears WHISPERS and freezes under the blankets. Hides the phone under her pillow and glances out...nothing in the room.
She returns to her cocoon, as --
WHISPERED VOICE (V.O.)
...all face a choice...
It's the same whispering as before, but we can make out a bit of it now. Sam sits still, waiting...but there's nothing more.
She grabs her phone and tucks back in: Opens Instagram and scrolls through Evexia's feed. Comes to a photo that seems to tag Willa's account, @spiritmatters. Sam clicks on it -- but it's blank.
Frustrated, she sits there a moment. Stuck. Begins looking up the other attendees. Goes to Heddy's profile and stops short.
Because it's full of pictures of HEDDY AND LIZA. At the beach in Malibu; at a comedy club; and a few photos in, a Polaroid of them at a wedding. Heddy in a suit with velvet bowtie, Liza in a printed white dress replete with all her jewelry.
Sam looks up. They're married?
QUICK FLASHES OF
-- Heddy and Liza standing near each other when Sam arrived.
-- Liza trying to console Heddy when she was angry about the food.
BACK ON SAM
Unsure what this means, but breathing heavily.
WHISPERED VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Commit to life, or commit to death...
She shakes her head like batting off a mosquito. The WHISPERING seems to be coming from all around her.
She looks up Jessica's profile. Scrolls through her photos -- no other attendees.
Looks up Tori's -- it's set to friends-only.
She sets the phone down. About to give up. Then looks back at Tori's profile, and sees Brooklyn, NY.
Goes back to Jessica's...also Brooklyn, NY.
QUICK FLASHBACK: Tori jumping up to hug Jessica after the roleplay exercise.
BACK ON SAM
Thinking through what it --
WHISPERED VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Death is nothing to be feared.
Sam notices a SHADOW falling over the blanket above her head. It grows, getting closer...the rough shape of a MAN'S HEAD...
SAM
What the FUCK.
She flips open the blankets. The room is still.
Sam gets up and strides over to her suitcase on the floor. She picks it up and SLAMS it onto the bed to start packing.
TITLE ON BLACK:
DAY FOUR:
RESTORING
EXT. YURT VILLAGE - MORNING
RAIN PELTS the roofs of the eight cabins. Grey-blue clouds swirling above.
INT. SAM'S YURT - MORNING
Sam peers through her window at Madison's yurt. Waiting.
EXT. MADISON'S YURT - MORNING
Sam KNOCKS quietly on Madison's door. Waits, but there's no response.
She squints through the window. No sign of her inside.
The door of the yurt next door OPENS and Sam pulls back from the window. Tori walks out. Offers a little morning wave.
TORI
See you up there?
Sam nods, feebly waving back. Glances back at Madison's empty window once more...
EXT. EVEXIA COURTYARD - DAY
The group's arranged in morning meditation. They're at the front edge of the house, right near the open slider, to keep out of the rain. Seated on pillows and all eyes closed.
All except SAM. Sam's scrutinizing Willa, as Willa guides their meditation.
Sam surveys the other women. Her eyes fall on the one empty pillow, where Madison should be.
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - DAY
The group eats from a plate of fruit. Everyone looks worn -- physically, emotionally, psychologically.
Sam sits in the corner, observing them all with suspicion.
She stares at HEDDY AND LIZA sitting next to each other as they talk with Jessica. So clear now that they're married.
Tori joins them and gives Jessica a friendly squeeze of the shoulder. Jessica smiles at her before returning to the conversation. Smiling like familiar friends.
And Aubrey's over by the fruit plate, cleaning her glasses on her shirt while Eva talks to her about something. Over it we hear FLASHBACKS OF:
SAM (V.O.)
Oh, you're in D.C. too?
AUBREY (V.O.)
And even worse, I'm a political consultant.
And then...
EVA (V.O.)
My mom... Well she's in government, and she's trying to get me to run...
Sam crosses her arms in thought.
Jessica gets up to refill her water bottle near the sliding glass door. Sam sidles up to her.
SAM
Hey...
JESSICA
Morning! How are you, sweetie?
Sam clocks her uncharacteristically bright demeanor.
SAM
Fine. Hey, have you seen Madison around?
JESSICA
Madison? No, I guess I haven't...
As she scans the room, Sam notices her GREY AND GLASSY eyes. Jessica turns back to her.
JESSICA (CONT’D)
But I'll keep an eye out for her.
SAM
Thanks.
Sam watches her go. Something overhead catches her eye, and she glances up at the SECOND FLOOR WINDOW above. Behind white curtains, a SILHOUETTED FIGURE is pacing.
Sam's eyes narrow...
INT. SOUND DOME - DAY
Willa's leading the group in an exercise: the attendees write things out on slips of paper, then pin them to a giant board that says "The New Me Will..."
Already on the board are things like "find beauty in my power, and power in my beauty," and "run for office!"
Jessica pins up one that says "find JOY in my sobriety" and the room CLAPS.
Sam looks at the doorway and sees NENITA pass by on one of the staff ATV's. There's a basket of herbs and berries strapped to the back, and for a moment she and Sam make EYE CONTACT.
Sam turns back to the group. She walks to the front of the room with her slip, and pins it to the "The New Me Will" board. Hers says "...not be intimidated."
The women APPLAUD AND CHEER, as Sam LOCKS EYES with Willa. She claps along with the others, and offers Sam an inscrutable smile...
EXT. SOUND DOME - LATER
Sam watches Willa lead the group towards the Treatment Center, all of them jogging and spinning and jumping for joy in the rain.
Sam quietly stays behind. She turns her eyes to Evexia House.
To that second floor window.
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - DAY
Sam steps inside and sees Kitty in the kitchen CHOPPING KALE. Sam looks beyond her, towards a little STAIRWAY leading up.
She tip-toes across the kitchen. Kitty hears something and turns. Sam ducks behind the counter.
She waits until Kitty returns to her work, then DARTS the rest of the way to the stairs.
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - STAIRCASE - DAY
Sam reaches the top of the winding stairs, and sees a door in the darkness.
She reaches for the handle but a RUSTLING SOUND stops her. Like what she heard during her body wrap.
She puts her ear to the door. Can't make anything out. Decides to open it...
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LOFT - DAY
The rain BEATS LOUDLY against the sheet metal roof above. There are a few buckets on the floor to collect leaks.
Sam walks in and can immediately identify the rustling sound as coming from an OLD DESK FAN on the desk, rickety as it rotates.
This place is WILLA'S BEDROOM AND OFFICE. It looks like a cross between a therapist's office and an antique store. Strange trinkets everywhere -- jewelry trees, snake skins and animal furs, taxidermy, and a large collection of gemstones and geodes.
Sam looks around.
SAM
Madison?
She comes to a CLOSED DOOR. Carefully turns the handle, opening it with a CREAK to find...
The BATHROOM. You can barely see the counter under all the jars, vials, and tubes of various products. None of them are familiar brands, they're all in glass mason jars and vials like what we saw Willa giving the other women.
Sam checks for any sign of Madison, then wanders back into the loft.
As she heads to Willa's desk, she takes a quick look out the window: the courtyard below is EMPTY, just raindrops forming puddles.
She opens a desk drawer and begins sorting through its contents -- papers, pens, etc. -- until something catches her eye.
She holds up a PHOTO ID. It's from British Columbia, and features a PICTURE OF WILLA, but she looks completely different. Unadorned, middle-class...ordinary.
The name on it reads JANE KRAUSE.
WILLA (O.S.)
Find anything interesting?
Sam whips around, hiding the ID behind her back.
SAM
Sorry. I was looking for Madison. I haven't seen her all day, and we were supposed to...
(on Willa's look)
...meet up this morning.
WILLA
Madison opted out of today's sessions.
Why?
SAM
WILLA
Don't you think you should be more focused on your own journey?
SAM
Well I just wanted to make sure she's okay.
WILLA
Why wouldn't she be?
SAM
Right. Yeah, I'm sure she's fine.
Sam subtly drops the ID back into the drawer and scoots back to slide it shut.
WILLA
Tomorrow's our final day together, Sam. It's so important that you prepare for it. I can't begin to describe what the transformation will feel like...but it only works if you give yourself over fully.
Every bit of that blame and guilt and pain you described to me yesterday...it'll all go away. I hope you know that's why I'm pushing you so hard.
Sam holds a moment...offers a small nod.
SAM
Sorry, I didn't realize this was your room.
She awkwardly walks past Willa, heading back down the staircase.
Willa watches her go, then turns back to her desk. Is the drawer still open a crack?
EXT. YURT VILLAGE - DAY
The rain has subsided, as Sam walks over the crunchy sand towards her yurt.
She's about to open her door when she hears CRYING.
She peers around the side of the structure, and sees SOMEONE HUDDLED in the distant brush.
She moves closer and realizes it's NENITA. She's rocking back and forth, cradling a picture in her hands and PRAYING.
Nenita hears the sand crunching and WHIPS AROUND.
SAM
Sorry, I --
NENITA
Why aren't you in treatment?
SAM
I'm trying to...
She catches a glimpse of the PICTURE.
SAM (CONT’D)
Is that your son?
Nenita hesitates, then lets Sam see it. An adorably pudgy boy with big brown eyes. Sam's eyes well up.
SAM (CONT’D)
He's beautiful. (turning to her)
Why did you leave me yesterday? Did you know she was going to come in like that?
Nenita shakes her head no, wiping the tears from her eyes.
SAM (CONT’D)
Nenita, tell me what's going on.
NENITA
I just got homesick.
SAM
Your hands are shaking. What's going to happen tomorrow? What is she making you do to us?
Nenita SNATCHES the picture back.
NENITA
You can't stop it. It's already done.
SAM
What is?
Nenita slowly rises, so she and Sam are face-to-face. Nenita collects herself, something hardening in her look.
NENITA
You should get back to your treatment.
Off their stare --
INT. SAM'S YURT - NIGHT
Sam pulls her PHONE out from under the mattress.
She types "Jane Krause wellness retreat" into the search engine. Several results come back.
She scrolls through a news article and we see pictures of a retreat, much like Evexia, but in the mountains of Canada. An entirely different aesthetic and philosophical look.
As she reads the article, we see flashes of "license revoked," "drugging," and "subliminal messaging."
Suddenly the WHISPERING again:
WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
Death is a choice.
Sam gets up from the bed and paces the room. Feels motion to her right and whips her head over -- but it's just her own reflection in the BATHROOM MIRROR.
She goes to it and looks at herself. The pustules have faded, and given way to FLAKY SKIN on her forehead.
She touches one of the flakes with her finger. Gently SCRATCHES at it, and some DEAD SKIN comes up.
Sam gently tugs, and it peels away more. She keeps pulling at it, down her forehead towards her nose...and an entire layer of DEAD SKIN comes off her face like a mask.
She looks at it in her hand. Her own snake's skin. Her heart is pounding through her chest...and then a lightbulb goes off.
She rushes back to her bed and snatches up her PILLOW. Peels the cover off and flips the bare pillow over in her hands.
She picks up the key to her room and STABS it into the pillow, sliding it down like a knife to slice it open. She digs her hands around inside, until they find something.
She pulls out a MICROSPEAKER. A tiny black circle the size of a button, with a small wire antenna coming out of the back.
Sam squints at it, puzzled -- then holds it to her ear:
WHISPERED VOICE (V.O.)
We'll all face a choice. A choice that has the power to change your life...
Sam's eyes light up, because this is the whispering she's been hearing -- and it's Willa's voice.
WILLA (V.O.)
...you must remember that death is nothing to be feared. Death is just another path...
Sam lets the speaker fall to the floor. Hands shaking.
She picks up her phone and DIALS 9-1-1. Holds it to her ear but it immediately BEEPS TWICE. She looks at the screen -- no reception, and the BATTERY ICON is red.
She looks to the window...
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
Sparse moonlight illuminates SAM RUNNING. She periodically stops to try calling again: Near the treatment center. Beyond the garden.
Finally she finds herself in open desert. The lights of Evexia mere blips.
She reaches a peaked dune, and tries one more time. The call goes through...it RINGS...
Then silence. She looks at her phone -- IT'S DEAD.
Sam stands there, terrified and totally unsure what to do. Then something grabs her attention. She turns to her right...
Nestled into the hill across from her, the DILAPIDATED WOODEN STRUCTURE she saw on her run. But now there's a faint orange glow coming from inside.
Sam squints at it.
EXT. ABANDONED RANCH BUILDING - NIGHT
As Sam walks up, she sees one of the STAFF ATV's parked nearby.
She reaches the door of the building, and peers through one of the dusty cracked windows.
SAM'S POV
Distorted, unclear...but seems to be lit by a lantern inside. Then a SHADOW CROSSES in front of the light.
BACK TO SAM
Jumping back, staying out of sight. She considers leaving...then reaches for the door...
INT. ABANDONED RANCH BUILDING - NIGHT
Sam sneaks in quietly. The light is far away in another room, plunging her mostly in darkness.
She rounds a corner, coming into a SMALL SQUARE ROOM
Peeled wood-paneled walls and a high ceiling. She looks up and sees HOOKS ON CHAINS hanging from the ceiling. A whole row of them.
This was a SLAUGHTERHOUSE.
Sam passes through the room and into another doorway, entering a
LONG HALLWAY
She can see the source of the light at the end of the hall, a SMALL LANTERN on the floor.
As she slowly passes down the hallway, the light grows.
She feels something on her face and gently peels it away. Just a cobweb.
She reaches the end of the hallway, standing directly over the lantern.
A few doorways surround her. She looks into one -- dark.
Glances into another -- sees STAIRS leading underground, and more ORANGE LIGHT coming from below.
Sam walks in and carefully descends a few stairs. She drops to all fours, peering out into...
THE CELLAR
Lit by a few lanterns, which illuminate that this musty, decaying room is being used as some sort of LABORATORY.
Vials, bottles, and various measuring instruments abound. The herbs and berries that she saw Nenita carrying earlier are sitting on one of the counters.
The room looks like a cross between an 1800's pharmacy and a greenhouse.
Sam reaches the bottom of the stairs and explores the room.
She picks up a small round cactus from a pile. Next to it, a handwritten recipe:
"...soak peyote buttons in water for six hours..."
She scans the rest of the counter: At the end, a neat row of finished bottles of the MILKY WHITE TONIC they've been drinking all week.
Suddenly there's a CREAKING noise that makes Sam whip around. Fog emerges from a doorway, as MADISON walks out. Her teeth and gums are BLACK AND RED with froth, just like Razan and Ana Sofia's were in the garden.
SAM
Madison!
Madison barely registers her, CACKLING to herself as she carries a tub from this walk-in freezer.
SAM (CONT’D)
Are you okay? What's going on?
Finally Madison seems like she sees her, and smiles weakly.
MADISON
Oh hey.
SAM
We were supposed to leave this morning, what are you doing down --
But then Sam notices what's in the tub: ItTs frozen body  parts. Human body parts.
Madison sets the tub down next to the empty serum and tonic bottles. The same bottles used for Sam's facial, and body wrap, and the tonics they've been drinking -- for all of it.
Madison takes out a thin fleshy piece of meat and sets it on the counter. Sam looks closer, and sees the piece of bone sticking out -- a HUMAN FOREARM.
Sam bends over and WRETCHES. Tries to collect herself, as Madison sets up an industrial blender.
SAM (CONT’D)
We have to get the fuck out of here. Do you understand?
She grabs Madison by the arm, and starts to lead her out.
MADISON
No! I have to finish...
SAM
Madison, it's not safe here. She has you --
MADISON
You don't understand, I have to finish before tomorrow...
SAM
You're on some kind of --
MADISON
...for the transformation.
Sam takes her arm again.
MADISON (CONT’D)
No!
Madison jerks away, sending a blob of black and red froth onto her clothes.
SAM
Ok, just...stay here! Don't go anywhere, ok? I'm going to get help!
Sam bolts from the cellar.
HALLWAY
She reaches the top of the stairs. But as she passes the lantern on the floor, she looks to end of the hall and SOMEONE SPRINTS BY.
Sam freezes in her tracks. Debates what to do, then tip-toes into the
ABANDONED ROOM
It's pitch black inside, just some faint moonlight coming in through a broken old window.
She waits quietly. Hears CREAKY FOOTSTEPS out in the hallway. Getting closer.
She looks around the room. Nowhere to hide. Then she notices part of one wall is decrepit with a PIECE OF PLYWOOD sticking out.
The footsteps grow louder as she peels back the old wood and tries to squeeze her body in.
Sam manages to slip inside the WALL, surrounded by splintered beams and nails sticking out in every direction. She peers back through the crack, and can make out a SHADOW PERSON stepping into the room. Quietly looking around.
Sam feels something at her feet. Hears a VERY SOFT RUSTLING NOISE. Holding her breath to stay quiet, she looks down...
A SNAKELET is slithering over her left foot. The little rattler she saw being birthed earlier. Sam lets out the tiniest of GASPS, and the Shadow Person jerks towards the wall.
Sam bolts.
She sprints along the inside of the wall, avoiding nails and beams and cobwebs. She winds her way towards another opening, and pushes her way through it.
She squeezes out and finds herself back in the hallway. She sprints towards the door she came in, glancing over her shoulder just as the Shadow Person steps out into the hallway. They sprint after her!
EXT. ABANDONED RANCH BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
Sam runs out in a panic. Looks around for a means of escape, and finally her eyes fall on the ATV.
VROOM!
Sam careens across the pitch-black desert, back towards Evexia, as behind her we see the Shadow Person reach the doorway of the old building and watch Sam go.
EXT. EVEXIA HOUSE - NIGHT
Sam speeds past the house and all their parked cars. She rounds a corner, heading for the front gate.
She guns it down the dirt entrance road, wind in her face.
But right as she passes under the EVEXIA sign, the ATV JERKS to a stop -- sending Sam SOARING over the handlebars.
A CLOUD OF DUST kicks up all around her, illuminated by the ATV headlights. The quad sits there stunningly frozen, engine still PURRING.
Sam lies in the dirt, wind knocked out of her. Puts a hand out to prop herself up.
SAM'S POV
Blinded by the headlights. Dizzy from the spill. Her eyes land on a METAL STRIP on the ground, running directly under the ATV tires. Some kind of magnetic barrier?
VOICE (O.S.)
Are you okay?!
BACK ON SAM
Squinting through the light as Nenita runs up to her.
NENITA
I heard noises. What happened?
SAM
I have to...Nenita, I need to...
Nenita keeps her from getting up.
NENITA
Shhh, Sam you're in shock.
SAM
No, I -- Madison...
NENITA
It's going to be okay.
Nenita rubs Sam's shoulder with one hand, as the other slowly rises into the air...
SAM
You have to listen. Madison's in there and we need to --
...and STABS A SYRINGE INTO SAM'S NECK.
A few moments of SILENCE. Then a few more.
TITLE ON BLACK:
DAY FIVE:
CUT TO BLACK.
TRANSFORMING
SLOW FADE IN:
SAM'S POV
Eyes blinking open. Woozy vision of WOODEN SLATS above. ON SAM
Barely conscious. Out of it from the sedative. Her eyes wander the room, which we now see is...
INT. DAIRY BARN - DAY
Sam's lying on a cot, on the floor of an old dairy barn. Hay and sawdust everywhere, and four other cots near her that are separated by old stall rails used for milking cows.
Surrounding the cots are various KEEPSAKES and MEMENTOS. A locket, a music box, a lock of hair, various photos.
Sam's eyes fall on one of the PHOTOS, leaning against a crate by the cot next to her. It's the picture of NENITA'S SON she saw earlier.
Sam lies back, confused and dizzy. Trying to regain control of her senses, but her body won't let her.
Something in her peripheral vision catches her eye. She tilts her head back, and can make out a CORNER OF PAPER sticking out of the hay directly behind her.
She weakly raises her arm towards it...but it's a good foot and a half out of reach.
A THUD makes her look back down -- the wooden door has just opened, and Nenita and Razan walk in.
Sam stiffens and tries to sit up, but her body isn't behaving. Her leg catches and she looks down -- her ANKLE IS ZIPTIED to the railing.
She looks up at Nenita and they lock eyes. Nenita looks like she's about to say something...until Razan takes her arm and jams a fistful of something into her palm.
Nenita looks down at her hand, full of SMALL NUTS that look like acorns. She reluctantly places a few in her mouth, and as she chews on them her teeth begin turning RED AND BLACK. Razan leads her out.
Sam lies back. Staring confusedly at the wooden slats above her.
Her eyes are drawn again to that corner of paper sticking out of the hay.
She squints and can make out part of a FACE. Something draws her to it, and Sam strains again to reach for it, trying harder and harder...but still can't.
She takes a few BREATHS to gather her strength. Reaches down to her ankle and tries to squeeze her foot out of the ziptie. She grits her teeth and pulls, but it's too tight.
Sam looks at the railing her ankle's tied to. Follows its path from her foot, curving upwards towards her head.
She reaches back down to her ankle and slides the ziptie along the railing. As it inclines, she lifts her leg, contorting her into something resembling a Twister pose.
She stretches back and reaches with all of her might...face red...and manages to SNAG THE PAPER between her fingers.
She collapses back onto the cot. Out of breath. She regains her strength and holds the paper up.
It's a wallet-size PHOTOGRAPH, dusty and crumpled. But as Sam cleans it off she can make out THREE SMILING FACES: a YOUNG MOTHER and TWIN DAUGHTERS.
ON SAM
Recognizing something in the photo... QUICK FLASH OF
The Sonic Drive-in, as the Disheveled Woman crawled towards Sam and Madison in the convertible. It's the same woman.
BACK TO SAM
Processing. Looking down at the empty cot she's sitting on. Closing her eyes...
BACK TO FLASHBACK
Looking closer at the woman...the LAVENDER JUMPSUIT under her raggedy jacket. The flashing of her SEVERED TONGUE.
NENITA (V.O.)
(from earlier)
They're very strict with the rules here...
QUICK FLASH OF
The TUB OF BODY PARTS from last night. BACK TO SAM
Opening her eyes. Fatigue and wooziness flooded by SUDDEN DISGUST.
She rolls onto her side and DRY HEAVES -- a CROAKY EMPTY SOUND, because there's nothing left to come up.
CUT TO BLACK.
More time goes by...then...
MADISON (V.O.)
Sam...
INT. DAIRY BARN - EVENING
Sam opens her eyes, still weak but more alert now.
The sun is setting outside, and a few candles have been lit around her.
She sees Madison sitting on the edge of her cot, and lurches towards her.
What's --
SAM
Shhhh.
MADISON
Madison holds her arms consolingly.
SAM (CONT’D)
You were all --
MADISON
It's okay.
SAM
No, we have to --
Sam feels her leg stuck, and looks down to see her ankle STILL ZIPTIED.
Her eyes slowly lift towards Madison. Confused and suddenly very scared.
MADISON
You kept breaking all the rules, Sam. Sneaking around late at night, stealing your phone... You've become totally paranoid.
SAM
She's been feeding us human bodies, and they're going to --
MADISON
You don't know what you're --
SAM
Do you even remember what you were doing last night?
MADISON
We're going to explain every --
SAM
We?
They lock eyes a beat.
SAM (CONT’D)
She drugged you. You didn't even --
MADISON
She didn't drug me. It's betel nut, and it's a totally natural stimulant that keeps you centered.
SAM
Centered?! You were frothing at the mouth breaking up body parts!
MADISON
Honey, you need to calm down.
SAM
(tearing up)
Why did you bring me here?
Madison gently rubs her arm.
MADISON
You're so close. You're so close, and I want to see you finish.
SAM
Did you know this is all going on?
MADISON
It's not what you think.
SAM
She's going to kill them tonight, isn't she? Nentia, Kitty...all these, what, young poor mothers? This "transformation" she keeps talking about is going to happen by killing them.
WILLA (O.S.)
'Killing' is such a western word for death.
They look over and see that Willa has come in unnoticed. She gazes down severely at Sam, no pretense of gentleness now.
WILLA (CONT’D)
So violent. In other cultures, death is seen as an extension of life -- not its terminus.
SAM
Even if you're forced into it?
WILLA
Death is always a choice, Sam. Your problem is clinging to this notion of it as tragedy. It's why there's no longer any light in your life.
Sam's winces, like she's just been punched in the gut.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Everyone must either commit to life, or commit to death. And tonight, you'll finally make that choice. We can't let you go; not with what you've seen here. So, you can either join the Lavenders, and give yourself over. Or...
Willa reaches into a pocket of her dress.
WILLA (CONT’D)
...you can join us, and claim the new life you came here to find.
She pulls out a SMALL VIAL of ruddy brown liquid -- identical to the ones we saw her give Eva and Heddy.
SAM
No.
MADISON
Think about it, Sam. Think about why you came here.
SAM
Not for this.
MADISON
You have to open your mind. I was skeptical at first too.
(MORE)
MADISON (CONT’D)
But then I thought about it...plants become our medicine; animals become our nutrients; it's completely natural that some people are destined to become our rejuvenation.
WILLA
I've seen such growth in you this week, Sam. You've moved so far from that dark place you started in.
Just imagine never being in that place again.
This hits Sam hard. Her face softens.
WILLA (CONT’D)
You've seen how it's transformed Madison's life. Tonight it's going to transform all these other women's lives. And I want that to include you.
Madison takes Sam's hand, and looks at her imploringly.
MADISON
All your pain can turn into power.
Sam returns her look. No longer arguing. Madison kisses Sam's cheek and rises.
Willa sets the vial down on a crate near Sam's cot, and she and Madison leave.
Sam sits there alone...staring weakly at the vial...
EXT. DAIRY BARN - NIGHT
The small structure sits peacefully as the MOON RISES.
INT. DAIRY BARN - NIGHT
Sam lies on the cot as before. Like she hasn't moved in hours. The only light now comes from the few CANDLES around her.
The door CREAKS open. Sam barely registers it, as though the fight's gone from her.
Willa walks in, and as she steps into the candlelight we can see she's now in a WHITE SILK DRESS.
Sam turns her head to look over. Behind Willa, Madison and the other attendees are in the doorway, all in matching white dresses, watching Sam expectantly.
Willa picks up the vial from the crate and gazes down at Sam. Sam meets her look.
WILLA
Have you made your choice?
Sam sits there a moment. She nods. Willa holds the vial out for her.
Sam takes it into her hands. Looks closely at the tendrily BROWN LIQUID inside.
She glances over at Madison, who nods encouragingly. Sam uncorks the vial. And drinks it.
She swallows it with a GULP. Tears fill her face, and Willa lays a consoling hand on Sam's back. Rubs her gently, like a mother to a daughter.
Madison walks into the room and joins them. Then Heddy, and Eva, and the others -- until the group of women are assembled in a GIANT EMBRACE around Sam.
EXT. DESERT CANYON - NIGHT
A FULL MOON illuminates the steep cliff faces and all their little crevices and blemishes, as the women wind their way along a NARROW PATH.
Sam is among them, now in a white dress matching the others.
INT. CRYSTAL GROTTO - NIGHT
Thousands of SPARKLY STALACTITES surround this isolated grotto. It's like a small cave of wonders, with hundreds of rainbow-colored CANDLES scattered around, whose light ricochets off the rock formations.
Sam walks in, in procession with the other attendees. Her expression blank like theirs.
They reach a small clearing at the center of the grotto, where nine SPA TABLES have been arranged in a semi-circle -- one covered in a lavender sheet in the center, flanked on either side by four white-covered ones.
Sam stands behind her table towards the end, and looks up to see FOUR OTHER TABLES in a semi-circle across from them. The Lavenders are lying on these tables, EYE MASKS over their faces and BELTS around their chests and thighs that strap them to the tables.
And in-between these two semi-circles, at the center of the clearing, is a large cylindrical GLASS TANK, filled with hissing hydrofluoric ACID.
On either side of the tank is a little table with BUTCHER KNIVES and SAWS, for the dismemberment that will follow.
The ground is covered with flower petals and dried grasses. A giant Pinterest altar.
Sam registers no emotion at seeing any of this.
Once they're all assembled, Willa enters the grotto in her white dress, wearing a CROWN OF WHITE FLOWERS.
She's carrying a small GOLDEN BOWL that's emanating smoke. She walks in a circle around the attendees and then places the bowl under the glass tank.
When she's finished, she stands in front of the glass tank and looks out at them.
WILLA
Can you feel the magic in this place?
Mumbles of agreement.
WILLA (CONT’D)
All of us are about to embark on a most important night. Those who have been here before can attest...
She glances at The Recruiters -- Madison, Tori, Liza, and Aubrey -- who are all to her left.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Tonight your old selves die. And new ones will be born.
She looks to her right at the Recruitees -- Sam, Eva, Jessica, and Heddy. They nod solemnly.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Remember on the first day, I said that by the end of the week we'd locate the beauty on your insides, to bring out all the beauty on your outsides? Tonight we complete that journey. Tomorrow you'll go back to the quote-unquote real world, and not a single motherfucker is going to recognize you goddesses.
The ladies LAUGH. Sam and Madison lock eyes and smile.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Before we begin, though... We thank those women making the sacrifice tonight. Their journey to a new vibration makes it possible for us to reach ours.
Willa turns to face the Lavenders, as the women LOUDLY APPLAUD THEM. Sam's eyes fall on Nenita, motionless under her eye mask.
Willa turns back.
WILLA (CONT’D)
Sister Madison...
Madison goes to the four Lavenders and AFFIXES IV's to each of their arms. Then two more to each of their thighs, and finally one to each of their foreheads.
All these tubes are connected to the acid tank, and on the other side of the tank are nine waiting IV tubes.
Once the Lavenders are set, Madison helps the attendees onto their tables and hooks each of them up to an IV.
Madison arrives at Sam, and waits expectantly with the needle.
MADISON
Are you ready?
Sam lies on the bed. Nods blankly, and looks up at Madison as she slides the NEEDLE into Sam's hand.
Madison goes to Willa last, hooking her up on the lavender- colored table. Then goes to her own table, and inserts her own IV.
Madison lies on her bed, and now they're all in place.
Willa holds up a SMALL REMOTE.
WILLA
Repeat the incantation with me: Those things cannot die which never carried life.
Sam repeats the chant with the other women.
ALL
Those things cannot die which never carried life.
WILLA
EVEXIA!
EVEXIA! EVEXIA!!!
EVEXIA!!!
ALL WILLA ALL
Willa presses the remote and the acid begins BUBBLING. ON NENITA'S ARM
As blood begins flowing out. Her other arm, and legs, and forehead empty out as well.
All the tubes RUN RED into the tank, and after it mixes with the acid and other ingredients, PURIFIED BLOOD runs out through the other tubes, filling up Willa and the attendees.
Willa places her hands on her chest and breathes deeply. She lifts her head and begins to lead the group in a CALL-AND- RESPONSE SONG.
WILLA
I fill my voids with beauty
I fill my voids with strength I fill my voids with clarity I fill my voids with life
SAM
ALL (CONT’D)
I fill my voids with beauty
I fill my voids with strength I fill my voids with clarity I fill my voids with life
stares blankly at the crystal icicles above her head. WILLA AND THE WOMEN
Glowing, as they SING EUPHORICALLY.
THE LAVENDERS
Turning pale, as the blood drains out of them fast. CLOSE ON NENITA
A TEAR streaming from under her eye mask. She SNIFFS. BACK ON SAM
Hearing the sniff.
Hearing, but not seeming to react.
Sam hears it again, and slowly turns her head.
Stares blankly. Then she BLINKS, and something in her face changes...
FLASHBACK: Sam on the cot in the dairy barn, just before Willa came back in. She picks up one of the candles and pours its wax down her throat -- to coat her stomach lining before drinking the vial.
BACK TO SCENE
Revealing Sam isn't watching Nenita, but Willa. And her eyes are sharp now. She's making sure Willa can't see her as she slides off her table.
Sam sneaks up to the acid tank. She carefully gathers all the Lavender's IV tubes in her hand, until it looks like she's holding a swarm of balloon strings.
OVERHEAD
Looking down on the four Lavenders, when suddenly, WHOOSH! All the IV's are ripped from their bodies at once.
ON WILLA
Her blissful trance broken by the SCREAMS. But by the time she sits up, her hair's yanked back and A SWARM OF NEEDLES appear at her neck.
She looks up to see
SAM
Holding the bunch of needles at her like a knife. Blood flows from them, covering their white robes.
Madison sees them and leaps to her feet.
MADISON
What are you doing?!
She starts running towards them.
SAM
Don't fucking move!
Madison SCREAMS.
MADISON LET HER GO!
The other attendees have sat up. The Lavenders stir in confusion, struggling against their restraints.
SAM
Untie them.
Madison and the others hesitate.
SAM (CONT’D)
Do it or I'll stab this bitch until her head comes off!
Madison reluctantly nods to the other women, and they obediently go unstrap the Lavenders.
WILLA
I don't know what you think you're doing, Sam, but --
SAM
SHUT UP!
MADISON
How DARE you talk to her like that!
WILLA
(to Madison)
Madison, will you listen to me next time?
MADISON
I'm sorry...I thought she was ready.
SAM
(bursting out of her) NOTHING could make me ready for this! ANY of it!! And my real
problem was not realizing that's a
good thing.
The other attendees have untied the Lavenders, who now take their eye masks off. Sam turns to them.
SAM (CONT’D)
Go ahead -- Run! I'll keep them here until you're out safe.
The Lavenders look amongst each other, confused.
Kitty starts walking...but as she passes the center tables, she picks up a BUTCHER KNIFE and holds it towards Sam.
SAM (CONT’D)
What are you doing? I'm freeing you!
Willa begins LAUGHING -- high pitched and squeal-like.
WILLA
OhMyGod you're so basic. You really thought I, what, kidnapped them?
Did you think they're hostages?
Sam looks at Nenita in confusion.
WILLA (CONT’D)
What have I been telling you this ENTIRE FUCKING WEEK?!
HEDDY
Everything at Evexia is a choice, Sam.
Kitty stops in front of Sam, aiming the butcher knife at her.
SAM
(confused) I don't...
WILLA
These beautiful girls are volunteers. They've chosen to be offerings, in exchange for which their families will receive just compensation. Much more than this world and its cruel, inhumane systems would ever afford them.
Sam looks back at Nenita and they lock eyes. Seeing each other fully now.
Madison picks up a bone saw and points it at Sam.
MADISON
(now demonic) LET HER GO!
Sam has no choice but to lower the needles from Willa's neck.
Willa joins Madison and the other women. It's everyone against Sam now.
Willa glares at her, eyes burning with power.
WILLA
Drain her.
Madison and Heddy eagerly GRAB Sam by the arms.
Sam struggles, as they drag her over to the Lavenders' tables. Right as they pass the center area, Sam ELBOWS Madison and Heddy in their jaws.
She lunges for the acid tank, heaving her shoulder into it with a GROAN...pushing and pushing until it TIPS OVER.
The glass tank hits the ground and SHATTERS, flooding the floor with STEAMING ACID. Yellow vapors fill the air as the women all SCREAM and try to jump onto their tables to avoid burning their feet.
WILLA
Watches in shock as the vapors rise to her face and her skin begins SIZZLING.
Madison and Heddy SCREAM and RUSH to help Willa. Their skin starts BUBBLING AND MELTING as well.
Sam and the Lavenders stand on the other side, watching in quiet shock.
In the panic, Sam and Nenita turn to each other. Willa strains to YELL at the Lavenders:
WILLA (CONT’D)
Kill her!! Kill her or your families get NOTHING!
Nenita stares hard at Sam. Sam stares right back. Nods at her in solidarity.
Nenita turns away and beckons to the other Lavenders. She leads them across the room, and they pick up the other saws and knives and begin ATTACKING THE ATTENDEES while they burn.
The attendees fight back and it turns into a full-scale BRAWL.
Sam navigates through it towards the cave's entrance, but suddenly Madison JUMPS in front of her -- eyes crazed and SKIN SIZZLING.
SAM
Come with m--
Madison SWINGS the bone saw, and Sam dodges it at the last second.
Sam sprints away. Madison chases, and gets close enough to GRAB Sam by the hair and throws her to the ground.
Sam hits the ROCK FLOOR hard. Wind knocked out of her. She looks back just as Madison's PLUNGES THE SAW towards her back.
Sam rolls to her right, and the saw KNICKS the side of her neck. Blood SPRAYS OUT.
MADISON
I never should've brought you here!
SAM
SO WHY THE FUCK DID YOU?
MADISON
Cause I thought you'd bring some fucking value to the movement -- but obviously I was wrong!
She lifts the saw again but Sam KICKS HER LEGS out from under her, sending Madison to the floor.
Sam SCRAMBLES TO HER FEET, but just as she starts to run there's a SQUISH as she grimaces and falls back.
She looks down and sees the BONE SAW STUCK IN HER CALF.
Madison rolls over and YANKS THE SAW OUT. Blood GUSHES, and Sam clutches her leg in pain.
Madison rises and holds the blade up near her face. She glares down at Sam, LICKING THE BLOOD off the saw's teeth.
Madison grips the handle and holds the saw out over Sam's chest. Sam tries to scoot back, but she's cornered against a wall of crystals.
Madison DIGS THE TEETH into Sam's chest and begins to SAW back and forth. Sam SCREAMS OUT in pain.
But just then an IV TUBE swings around Madison's neck and constricts like a snake. Madison drops the saw and grabs at her neck.
NENITA appears behind Madison, gripping both ends of the tube tight as Madison FLAILS AND CHOKES desperately.
Sam locks eyes with her old friend...Madison's lips warped into a frown from the melting skin...and as the tube digs into her neck, the life leaves Madison's face and she dies.
Nenita lets her fall to the ground. She and Sam look at each other. Nenita nods, mirroring Sam's nod from before.
EXT. DESSERT - NIGHT
Sam limp-runs back towards Evexia.
EXT. EVEXIA COURTYARD - NIGHT
Sam stops short of breath. Sees their CARS parked on the other side of the house.
She thinks a beat -- Where would the keys be? -- then limp- runs down one of the paths...
INT. TREATMENT CENTER - NIGHT
Sam runs up to the corner of the room where the cell phone trunk was -- but it's gone now.
She looks around the rest of the room. Nothing.
EXT. EVEXIA HOUSE - NIGHT
Sam reaches the front of the house and is about to slip inside, but stops when she hears a SCREAMING in the distance.
She squints into the night, but can't make anything out. She opens the door to the house...
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
Sam soldiers up the stairs, leaving a trail of blood behind her.
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LOFT - NIGHT
Sam stumbles into Willa's loft and begins searching. Throws everything off the desk and pulls out each of the drawers.
As she empties one, she comes across a STACK OF PAPERS that give her pause.
One page has HER FACE on it, with a description of her FDA JOB. Next to it: "...can aid in pharmaceutical expansion."
-- Another of EVA, with a mention of "potential political influence."
-- Of JESSICA, with "legal consultation."
-- Of HEDDY, with "social influence."
Horrified, she tosses the papers aside and looks all around the room.
SOMETHING SILVER on the wall catches her eye -- a small rectangular BOX, like a safe, glowing in the moonlight.
She runs to it and finds a PADLOCK. She tugs at it, to no avail.
She finds one of Willa's GEODES on the ground and SMASHES IT against the lock, breaking it off.
She flips the box open, finding a ROW OF CAR KEYS on hooks.
INT. EVEXIA HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
Sam hobbles back down the pitch-black staircase, Mustang keys in hand.
A light FLIPS ON and we see Willa standing at the bottom of the stairs, blocking Sam's path. Her nose and cheeks have collapsed from the acid, revealing plastic implants and years of cosmetic work.
She runs at Sam SWINGING A MEAT CLEAVER. Sam jukes and the cleaver STRIKES the wooden wall next to her head. As Willa YANKS it out, Sam runs past her into the kitchen.
Willa follows as Sam scrambles to find something to shield herself with. At the last second, Sam grabs a baking sheet and holds it up -- SPARKS FLY as the cleaver strikes against it.
Willa swings again, and Sam blocks again -- but this time the force of the blow KNOCKS THE SHEET from her hands.
Sam rushes to pick it up, but in the reflection of the gleaming metal sees Willa raising the cleaver behind her. Sam runs straight into the kitchen counter and spins around.
Willa comes savagely towards her, swinging wildly. Sam reaches behind her, feeling all around the counter for something -- anything -- to defend herself.
Willa corners Sam and raises the cleaver over her head. But just then SAM'S HANDS wrap around something on the counter, and Sam lunges at Willa's face -- stabbing her through the eye with a pair of metal chopsticks.
Willa's stunned. Stands there in shock, as the cleaver CLANGS to the floor.
She wraps her hand around the chopsticks and swiftly YANKS them out. A MIX OF FLUIDS GUSH from her eye cavity, as Willa falls to the floor with a THUD.
EXT. EVEXIA HOUSE - NIGHT
Sam runs down the row of cars.
She TRIPS over a tree root, and drops the keys. Fumbles around for them in the darkness.
Finally she comes to the MUSTANG.
INT. CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
The engine ROARS to life and Sam backs the car up. She SPEEDS towards the entrance road.
She turns onto it...but then something catches her eye in the REARVIEW MIRROR. She looks back.
SAM'S POV
Figures struggling in the darkness. The melee appears to have made its way back to campus.
BACK ON SAM
Debating. She looks ahead -- can see the EVEXIA SIGN in the distance. So close.
But she throws the car into park.
EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
Sam steps out of the car, leaving the door open. DING, DING.
She takes a few steps towards the commotion. Can hear YELLING in the distance.
She sees Nenita in a struggle with Heddy and Tori. They have Nenita on the ground, and Heddy pins her arm while Tori tries to CUT HER VEIN open with a knife.
Sam starts to run towards them...but then ANA SOFIA appears behind Tori and YANKS her hair back before SLITTING HER THROAT.
Nenita uses the moment to BITE Heddy's arm, and Heddy SCREAMS in pain as Nenita HEADBUTTS her.
Nenita and Ana Sofia rise, as Razan and Kitty run up carrying CANS OF GASOLINE.
NENITA
We'll go finish them off and raid the place.
Razan nods.
RAZAN
We'll torch it to the ground.
The four of them RUN OFF in different directions.
Seeing that they have it under control, Sam trots back to the car and gets in. She shifts into drive and GUNS IT.
INT. CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
Sam's eyes tear up in relief as Evexia disappears behind her. Wind in her face as she lets out quick and manic SOBS. She passes under the sign and turns onto the RURAL ROAD.
EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT
The CONVERTIBLE'S HEADLIGHTS carve out the road in front of her, as she winds her way back to civilization.
INT. CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
Sam tries to focus on the road, growing weak from the loss of blood. She looks down at her CALF, and tries to find something in the car to stop the bleeding.
This makes it impossible for her to see Willa sitting up in  the back seat. She's a terrifying mess now, blood all over her empty eye socket, but she manages to raise her arms and abruptly WRAP HER HANDS over Sam's face.
Sam FLAILS as Willa grips as hard as she can, one hand hugging Sam's throat against the headrest while the other CLAWS at the skin on her face and blocks her vision.
EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT
The car SWERVES off and on the road, as it nears the ravine they passed on arrival.
INT. CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
Sam struggles against Willa's grip, pulling and biting and squirming -- but Willa holds fast.
Life drains from Sam's face. She tries to keep the car steady, as she feebly pats Willa's arms in futile attempts to free herself.
She's just about to fade...chin lowering towards her chest...but as she stares down at her lap and THE SEATBELT COVERING IT, something shifts in her eyes.
One last pulse of resolve.
CLOSE ON SAM'S EYES
Lifting towards the road.
SAM'S POV
Seeing the WINDY ROAD in front of them, and the GUARDRAIL to their right, protecting them from the ravine below.
SAM'S HANDS
Gripping the STEERING WHEEL. Jerking the wheel left...then a hard right into the guardrail.
SMASH!!!
EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT
The Mustang SLAMS INTO THE GUARDRAIL, sending Willa flying from the backseat.
ON SAM
Face smashing into the AIRBAG that's just deployed.
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
A moonlit assemblage of CACTI. Quiet. Serene.
Suddenly, Willa falls into frame and her stomach CRASHES into a cactus.
CLOSE ON CACTUS
Now bathed in red, mysterious grey ropes draped over it. A WIDER SHOT reveals
WILLA
Lying on the ground, disemboweled. Her INTESTINES run up to the cactus like party streamers -- her insides matching her outsides.
INT. CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
Sam lies against the airbag, back rising with EACH HEAVY BREATH.
CUT TO:
EXT. FRY HARD - NIGHT
A small neon sign glows above this 24-hour diner that sits alone on the side of the highway.
INT. FRY HARD - NIGHT
TIFF, sixty-something waitress with cat-eye glasses, leans against the cashier counter lazily flipping through a magazine. She resembles the older jogging woman from the very beginning of the movie, and is played by the same actress.
The door DINGS and Tiff looks up.
TIFF
Evenin', how ya --
Sam stumbles in. Blood, sweat, and sand everywhere, and hair matted to her face.
TIFF (CONT’D)
Oh my god. Are you okay?
SAM
(barely a whisper) Help.
TIFF
Ok, I'm gonna -- You stay right -- Mark!
Tiff runs off, as Sam stands there barely conscious.
She wanders down the row of booths, in some kind of daze. Slumps into one and sits there.
Tiff rushes back.
TIFF (CONT’D)
Ok, the ambulance is on its way, hon. What the hell happened to you?
Sam looks over at Tiff. Stares blankly.
TIFF (CONT’D)
Don't you worry about it. Here...
Tiff grabs a plate from the next table and places a half- eaten order of FRIES in front of Sam.
TIFF (CONT’D)
Do you need something in your stomach?
Sam looks down at the fries. Picks one up and looks at it.
TIFF (CONT’D)
There ya go, darlin'. Eat all you want.
Tiff slides into the booth with her and dips a napkin in a water glass. She dabs it along Sam's face to clear away the blood and grit.
TIFF (CONT’D)
You're okay now. You're okay.
As Tiff finishes cleaning her up, something in Sam's face catches her eye and she slowly pulls back the napkin.
Sam catches her staring.
TIFF (CONT’D)
Sorry...
Tiff gets up from the booth and heads towards the kitchen. She stops and looks back at Sam.
TIFF (CONT’D)
You're just...really stunning.
Tiff smiles with embarrassment and leaves.
Sam sits there a moment. Confused. She turns to look at herself in the LARGE MIRROR on the wall.
SAM'S POV
Looking at her reflection. Sweaty and gross, yes, but also...the rashes and blemishes and flakiness have all cleared up. A new layer of skin has brought with it a certain...glow.
Sam doesn't look worn or sad or guilty anymore. There's a new life in her eyes, and it renders her fucking radiant.
CLOSE ON SAM'S FACE
Assessing her image in the mirror. Communing with herself. A serene yet piercing gaze...almost like Willa's...
And just as the corners of her lips curl up into a smile --
CUT TO BLACK.
