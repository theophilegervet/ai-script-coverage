INT. CDC CONFERENCE ROOM - ATLANTA, GA - DAY
SUPER: 13 YEARS AGO - THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT PLAGUE
At the Center for Disease Control, SCIENTISTS watch multiple TV monitors.
INTERCUT TV BROADCASTS
TV #1
The disease has been reported in the city of Dubai, now making it officially in twelve countries across the globe.
TV #2
Reports are coming in saying that the country’s National Guard has been called to active duty while other states--
TV #3
People everywhere are raiding pharmacies and buying up flu- related medicines--
TV #4
Director of the CDC Steven Jaetson made a statement earlier today.
STEVEN JAETSON (56), straight-laced, three-piece business suit, no nonsense type and head of the CDC, stands behind a podium. A man with a reputation of being strict, stern, and straight to the point.
STEVEN
At this time we are encouraging people with flu-like symptoms to seek medical help immediately and to keep contact with others to a bare minimum. The important thing is to stay calm.
DR. JANET RICHARDS (28). A Native Georgian and the classic perfect example of a Georgia Peach, sits at a desk watching the broadcast.
JANET
Bossman doesn’t look too pleased now does he.
Director Jaetson enters the room and mutes the volume on the televisions.
STEVEN
Alright everyone, what do you have?
DR. DAVID CHUNG (35), your stereotypical nerd/Dungeons & Dragons player, conspiracy theorist and tech guru of the team, approaches a projection screen and begins his presentation.
DAVID
Based on reports from our friends overseas, the virus was first seen
EMILY HENSTRIDGE (23), multi-color streaks of hair to match her bright and chipper personality, lab assistant and computer expert, raises her hand.
EMILY
My sources say those reports from Russia may have been released late. Also that it’s a lot worse there than the government is letting on.
JANET
This thing’s popped up and spread faster than the biblical plague.
STEVEN
Minutes ago, the President was made aware of cases appearing in the
U.S. We’ll be receiving a sample shortly. David and Emily, you two start getting the lab ready. I need to talk to Dr. Richards alone.
David and Emily leave the room.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
Since William is not here yet, I am putting you in charge of this one. We need to find a cure and we needed it done yesterday.
JANET
I can handle it.
STEVEN
The President will be declaring Martial Law soon. Things are going to get rough. It’s going to be a lot of weight to bear.
Janet kisses Steven.
INT. CAR OF WILLIAM MCCORD - ATLANTA, GA - SAME
WILLIAM MCCORD (33), an absent-minded professor crossed with a kind-hearted Jack Pearson/This is Us personality, drives down a busy street.
William talks on his cell.
WILLIAM
Got the kitchen stocked with a good two weeks of food and medicines. On my way to work now. Traffic is nuts.
JENNIFER MCCORD (33), wife to William, is heard on the other end.
JENNIFER (O.S.)
Just be careful out there.
School bells ring in the background over the phone.
JENNIFER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Looks like they’re letting the kids out now.
WILLIAM
Tell Delilah I love her.
JEDIDIAH SAUNDERS (42), African American, long-knotted beard, dreadlocks, tattered clothing, a homeless man, dazed and disoriented, coughs while walking toward the street.
JENNIFER (O.S.)
I will. Love you.
WILLIAM
Love you too.
Jedidiah stumbles out into the road.
William slams on the brakes and exits the car.
EXT. CITY STREET - SAME
Jedidiah lays motionless as William rushes up to his side.
WILLIAM
Jesus, are you alright? I didn’t see you there.
JED
I didn’t mean to... not feeling...
The man starts to cough as his body goes into convulsions.
WILLIAM
Somebody call 911!
INT. SCHWARTZ RESIDENCE - AUSTIN, TX - SAME
A modest two-story, two car garage styled home. Yard, freshly cut with vines that cover a white picket fence. In front of the fence, a typical plain metal mailbox with the name, SCWARTZ.
INSIDE: Inexpensive furniture fills the house as various framed photos of family and friends align the walls.
Books about various countries and their cultures fill the bookshelves with framed documents of multiple patents spread out on top.
INT. SCHWARTZ RESIDENCE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME
LAURA SCHWARTZ (28), the classic girl-next-door, sits upright in her bed under the covers, coughing and blowing her nose. A television news broadcast plays faintly in the background.
A knock at the bedroom door.
LAURA
(coughing) Come in.
PETER SCHWARTZ (28), a reluctant genius, down with the establishment type, hippie-casual attire, walks in carrying a brown paper bag.
PETER
Feeling any better?
LAURA
No and the cough medicine isn’t working. Neither is the throat spray. Do you think I have it?
PETER
Nah, you have the basic flu, sweetie. They say it is extremely contagious and I’m feeling OK.
LAURA
You’ve never been sick. Not even when you were little.
PETER
Pretty sure I couldn’t even handle something like that.
Peter pulls out a container of soup from the bag.
PETER (CONT'D)
Also, dropped by that sandwich shop you like and got you some chicken noodle soup.
Laura grabs the container, opens the lid and tries to smell the contents.
LAURA
If only I could smell it.
Peter pulls out a small rectangular box wrapped with a bow.
PETER
I also got you this.
Peter hands over the gift. Laura opens the present.
A picture of Laura and Peter in front of a straw cabin surrounded by a large group of African villagers in a picture frame.
I love it.
LAURA
Laura places the picture on her bed-side table.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Any word on how they’re doing over there?
PETER
Everyone’s fine, so far.
LAURA
Peter, working with the Peace Corps. is great and everything--
PETER
But?
LAURA
You’re wasting your talent. I know how much you like helping others.
PETER
Laura--
LAURA
You did great things as an engineer. Your patents are--
PETER
Are what pays for my ability to go out and help others.
LAURA
And your medical studies--
PETER
Will still be there when I’m ready to continue them.
A news flash appears on a muted television playing in the background: President addresses the nation on the outbreak.
LAURA
President is on.
Laura turns up the volume.
PRESIDENT HOWARD J. WILLIAMS (57), enters the press room and approaches the podium.
PRESIDENT WILLIAMS
Today, reports of the new super flu spreading across the globe has officially made its way to the United States. Anyone experiencing severe flu-like symptoms, please call the number appearing--
Laura goes into severe coughing fit. Her body stiffens as her eyes roll into the back of her head.
Peter jumps on the bed and holds her tight to his chest.
PETER
Laura?
She doesn’t respond.
Peter pulls out his cell phone and calls the number on the screen.
PETER (CONT'D)
Hold on. I’m right here.
INT. CDC LABORATORY - SAME
Doctors Richards, Henstridge and Chung dressed in biohazard gear, work in a sealed-off lab.
David prepares multiple test tubes while Emily preps the lab, moving equipment from one area to another.
Janet researches viruses in a database as she prints out results sent to her from other labs across the globe.
Steven Jaetson observes from the other side of a glass window as he activates a microphone.
STEVEN
Anybody know where the hell McCord is?
EMILY
No word yet sir. Good news is, we got an update from Russia.
DAVID
Shared group reports from our friends overseas say that the virus has three unrecognizable proteins.
JANET
The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in the UK suggests that the proteins may be synthetic.
DAVID
If they are, not any I’m familiar with. Nothing matching in the database either. I smell black-ops all over this.
JANET
You’ve watched too many X-Files, shug’.
William walks into the room with the glass partition where Steven is.
JANET (CONT'D)
Hey there, ‘bout time you made it.
WILLIAM
Sorry, got here as soon as I could. What do we have so far?
William clears his throat as his brow starts to bead-up with sweat.
You OK?
STEVEN
Janet give a quick “step away” look to Steven.
Steven walks away from William to the other side of the room.
WILLIAM
Exhausted. The last couple of hours were hell. School let out early due to some kids being sick. My wife had to drop everything and pick up Delilah. Also had to take a homeless man to a hospital. Came here after the emergency room.
Janet runs over to a wall and slams her hand down on a large red button.
Protective glass drops from the ceiling surrounds William on the other side of the partition. Caging him in glass.
ALARMS
JANET
William may be infected sir.
WILLIAM
It hasn’t made it this far yet.
STEVEN
It officially hit the U.S. a few hours ago. Figures, the one day you show up late.
EXT. SCHWARTZ RESIDENCE - HOUSTON, TX - NIGHT
SUPER: 12 HOURS LATER
The white picket fence now lays on the lawn in piece. Tire tracks run across a once perfectly cared for lawn all the way to an open front door.
CDC vans now rest parked on the lawn, close to the front door of the house.
The back doors of the vans fly open.
Laura, unconscious on a stretcher surrounded by plastic, is wheeled into one of the vans.
VARIOUS SCIENTISTS in bio-hazard suits fill the other with lab equipment and a large box marked CAUTION: SAMPLES.
Peter runs out the door. His arms, covered with band-aids various sized patches. In the middle of both arms, tight gauze holds a cotton ball in place.
TWO CDC AGENTS grab him before he can approach the van.
PETER
Where you taking her!
The two CDC agents drag Peter to his front room and sit him on the couch.
PETER (CONT'D)
Where you taking her, damn it!
CDC AGENT
Sorry Mr. Schwartz, but your wife’s condition has gotten worse. We just can’t provide the proper medical care for her here.
DR. JOSEPH EDWARDS (46), tall, slender in face under a bio- hazard suit, walks through the front door and into the living room.
JOSEPH
Now Mr. Schwartz, please calm down.
PETER
What’s wrong with her Dr. Edwards? Why won’t she wake up?
JOSEPH
Your wife has slipped into a coma.
PETER
Coma?
Dr. Edwards coughs.
JOSEPH
We’re getting reports from all over the world. No deaths yet, but--
Joseph goes into a sever coughing fit that brings him to his knees.
Peter bends down, takes his hand and lifts him back on his feet.
PETER
None of you are looking too good.
JOSEPH
All your test results came back negative for infection. Peter--
PETER
You want us to go to the CDC for further study. Am I right?
JOSEPH
Thank you, I know we’ve asked and done a lot already.
PETER
I obviously have a natural immunity to this.
(MORE)
PETER (CONT'D)
If I have to give more samples to help you guys figure this thing out, so be it.
Joseph takes a seat on a nearby chair, coughs again and spits up a little blood.
Peter gabs ahold of the hood and begins to remove it.
JOSEPH
(still coughing) Don’t.
PETER
Really? Kind of pointless now, don’t ya think?
Peter grabs some nearby medical gauze and hands it to him as he helps Joseph take off the suit.
Joseph wipes the blood away from his mouth.
PETER (CONT'D)
Come on. The sooner we can get on the road, the better.
Peter takes Joseph’s hand, places it around his shoulder and helps to walk him to the front door. Peter see the two men from earlier passed out in the back of the van with Laura.
PETER (CONT'D)
You think you can make it--
Joseph goes completely limp in Peter’s arms.
Peter places Joseph in the passenger seat, takes the keys to the van, straps him in, takes a seat at the wheel.
INT. CDC - HALLWAY - DAY 3 - DAY
Janet, a tad paler in complexion than before, stands at the doorway as Laura is wheeled in by two CDC agents.
JANET
Down the hall and to the right, gentlemen. Second door down.
The two men acknowledge the request as they walk by. Peter walks through the door with Joseph in-tow.
Joseph coughs.
JOSEPH
Hey, Janet. Good to see you. What’s with the lockdown.
JANET
The entire building has been infected. All of us.
JOSEPH
Hope you got room, for one more.
Peter places Joseph in a wheelchair as he passes out.
JANET
He wasn’t kiddin’ was he? Thank you for coming in Mr. Schwartz.
PETER
Anything to help my wife. Whatever you need from me, you’ll get.
Peter get behind the wheelchair and grabs the handles.
Where to? This way.
PETER (CONT'D) JANET
The three walk down a hallway.
JANET (CONT'D)
How long has he been like this?
PETER
Started showing signs about two days ago. Got worse on the way here.
JANET
Most everyone is out sick. This thing is everywhere.
PETER
I’ve worked jobs as a lab-tech before, I’ll do whatever I can to help.
JANET
We don’t usually recruit civilians. Let’s get this guy settled. We’ll start your tests and discuss your medical background. See what you can do from there.
Janet and Peter carry Joseph down the hallway.
Time passes. As Radio Broadcasts play, a split screen image of our Homeless Man and Laura Schwartz shows a glimpse into mankind’s future.
R.B. 1
Cities across the globe are without power as what has been now dubbed as “The Enders” virus, named after the phrase “The End of Days”--
SPLIT SCREEN:
Laura Schwartz/Jedidiah Saunders
IN UNISON: Tossing and turning in their hospital beds. Their breath quickens as their bodies convulse, going into a seizure.
R.B. 2
Multiple reports of people slipping into comas are coming from all over the planet. While nobody appears to have died through their long-term exposure--
SPLIT SCREEN:
IN UNISON: Jed and Laura’s eyes open and turn solid blue in color. A spark of electricity illuminates from their eye- sockets.
R.B. 3
Riots begin to break out among cities nationwide as the first death tolls from the End of Days virus hit half a million world- wide.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM OF JEDIDIAH SAUNDERS - DAY
Jedidiah Saunders sleeps peacefully in bed with monitors working in the background.
DR. ANNA MONTGOMERY (35), wearing a doctor’s coat covered in bright cheerful stickers, a Patch Adams type of doctor, enters.
Jedidiah awakens.
Morning.
ANNA
JED
Where am I?
ANNA
Northside Hospital. You gave us quite the scare there, sir. Mind telling me your name?
Doctor Montgomery grabs the man’s chart and begins to take notes.
JED
Jed. Jedidiah Saunders.
ANNA
Have any family we can call for you Jed? Let them know you’re OK.
JED
No. No family. How did I get here? Last thing I remember was stumbling into traffic. Did I get hit by a car?
Doctor Montgomery puts the chart down, pulls out an ear thermometer and starts to take Jed’s temperature.
ANNA
You came down with that Super Flu that got everybody. Almost everyone here called in sick. We’re a little behind schedule right now.
Doctor Montgomery removes the thermometer.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Your temperature is back to normal. That’s good.
JED
When can I leave?
ANNA
Let’s get you another day of rest just for observation. You were in a coma for a few days.
JED
I can’t afford this--
ANNA
The guy in the car is paying for all of this. Works for the CDC.
JED
Thank you doctor and please tell him... I’m sorry, what’s his name?
ANNA
Mr. McCord.
JED
Please tell Mr. McCord thank you.
ANNA
I will. Just get some rest. I’ll check back in with ya later.
Doctor Montgomery exits.
Jed stares at the door for a brief moment and gets out of bed.
The song by Fleetwood Mac: Never Going Back Again, plays from here without cut and/or edit until the end of the next three scenes.
Jed walks over to the partition leading to the adjacent room. He moves his hand over the lock in a circular fashion. The door unlocks.
INT. NORTHSIDE HOSPITAL - ROOM ADJACENT TO JEDIDIAH - SAME
Jedidiah steps through and looks at the man sleeping in the bed. He focuses his attention towards the closet in the room, walks over and proceeds to remove the man’s clothing and a small leather case.
INT. NORTHSIDE HOSPITAL - JEDIDIAH’S HOSPITAL BATHROOM - SAME
Jedidiah wipes the moisture off the bathroom mirror, opens the small leather case and pulls out a pair of scissors, a razor and shaving cream.
INT. NORTHSIDE HOSPITAL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE JEDIDIAH’S HOSPITAL ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER
Lights down the corridor flicker while others are completely off.
A door opens.
Jed emerges, covers his head with the hood of the jacket and walks out into the hallway. As he heads down the hallway, light fixtures he walks by light up as he exits the scene.
Song ends.

The ball snaps. The Enders Girl plows through the two Varsity boys in front of her. Both boys are sent twirling in the air before hitting the ground.
The Enders Girl tackles the Quarterback, launching the boy backwards five yards.
V.O. 6 (CONT'D)
Mostly due to safety concerns.
ENDERS GIRL
Sorry, didn’t mean to do that. You guys alright?
The boys lay motionless, moaning.
ENDERS GIRL (CONT'D)
Guys?
INT. PETER’S CAR - NIGHT
SUPER: PRESENT DAY
Peter drives through a residential suburban area.
Signs for the next Presidential election fill the front yards: Vote for someone we KNOW we can trust. Someone we KNOW is pure of SPIRIT, BLOOD and AMERICAN BELIEFS. VOTE AB-, VOTE JOHN KNOWELS.
INT. SCHWARTZ RESIDENCE - ATLANTA, GA -SAME
A modern two story home, large attic on top. The backyard contains an extremely old and large tree with branches that stretch and reach the home.
A tire swing hangs from the tree that’s surrounded by a tall wooden fence creating a large back yard complete with a high- quality gas grill in front of a large in-ground swimming pool.
Peter parks the car in the driveway, exits the car with briefcase in hand and enters the house.
The new home is filled with modern furniture. The same pictures from earlier now align the walls among newer photos that include their daughter STACY SCHWARTZ from various stages of her childhood.
Diplomas and various Doctorates in biology and genetics in Peter’s name now rest on top of the bookshelves among his many patents.
A TV plays a local news report.
TV REPORTER
The DNA Registration Act unanimously passed the Senate and House floors today. Once signed into law, it will be mandatory for all newborns to have their blood type and DNA registered in a national database--
Peter changes the channel.
ADVERTISEMENT
Thinking of starting a family but unsure of what kind of future your child will have? Come by and visit one of Gen-Corps family planning centers. We have the largest samples of untainted human DNA in the country.
Laura enters.
PETER
Can you believe this crap?
ADVERTISEMENT
With a free consultation, we can give your future loved one the normal childhood they deserve.
Peter turns off the TV.
LAURA
How was work today?
PETER
Good.
Sounds of movement upstairs.
PETER (CONT'D)
How was her school today?
LAURA
A group of high school boys got caught off-campus beating a nine year old. Parents are freaking out.
PETER
The child alright?
LAURA
He’ll be fine. The boys have been arrested, but still--
PETER
I know what you’re feeling.
LAURA
There’s something else.
PETER
What is it?
LAURA
Stacy’s school called. They say her IQ is one of the highest they’ve ever seen.
PETER
So? She’s just a kid. You’re thinking she’s one of them. An Ender’s child.
Laura turns her back to her husband with his arms still wrapped around her.
LAURA
You’ve seen how she is. You tell me she’s not, special. And with the local schools now. They become less safe every day.
Laura pulls out a pamphlet from her front pocket and hands it to Peter.
LAURA (CONT'D)
That new charter school opened.
Peter takes the pamphlet.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Will you at least promise me you’ll think about it?
PETER
OK, I’ll think about it.
Laura turns around and embraces her husband, their heads next to each other. Her eyes turn a solid blue.
LAURA
I love you.
Laura eyes go back to normal with a blink as she releases her husband.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Dinner will be ready in about 20 minutes. Why don’t you go get her?
Laura walks into the kitchen.
Peter heads up the staircase to the second floor. OFF IN THE DISTANCE:
LAURA (CONT'D)
She has a permission slip you need to sign for her trip to the zoo next week.
Thank you.
PETER
INT. BEDROOM OF STACY SCHWARTZ - SAME
STACY SCHWARTZ (12), a gifted, kindhearted child with a sharpness of tongue when needed. One of the first of her generation and THE GIRL from the beginning of our story.
She relaxes on her bed listening to a language learning app on her phone while she reads: The Conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar, Original Latin text.
Bookshelves overflow with works by and about Alexander the Great, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Maya Angelou, Albert Einstein, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, and Ray Bradbury.
A large telescope sits in front of her window, while glow-in- the-dark stickers in the shape of stars and planets decorate the walls of the room.
Peter opens the door while knocking.
STACY
Hey, pop.
PETER
Hey, kiddo. What ya listening to?
STACY
How to speak Aramaic.
PETER
What happened to Latin?
STACY
Too easy. Only took five days. Hoping Aramaic will give an actual challenge.
Peter picks up the book.
PETER
Julius Caesar?
STACY
He’s really long-winded.
Peter sits down beside his daughter.
PETER
Stacy, sweetie, have you ever thought that maybe--
STACY
Maybe what?
PETER
That maybe you’d be better off in a different school.
STACY
This is about that test the school made us take, isn’t it?
PETER
There’s nothing wrong with being special, sweetie.
STACY
I can’t leave my school. All my friends are there. Please don’t make me leave.
PETER
Your mom is pushing for you to go to one of those special charter schools and she’s got a good point. Unless you’re going to tell me that all twelve-year-olds read the works of Julius Caesar? Seriously?
Stacy goes silent.
PETER (CONT'D)
You have a permission slip for me to sign?
STACY
On the desk.
Peter walks over to the desk and signs the slip.
STACY (CONT'D)
Look, Pop, I just want to go to a normal school. Besides, I’m the smartest one there. Big fish in the small pond, why would I give that up?
PETER
Dinner is almost ready. And if you want your mother to calm down on the school stuff, take all this down a notch. Stop showing off.
STACY
I will. And Pop, thanks. Love you.
Peter exits.
Stacy places her ear buds back in. She swipes the Aramaic program to one side of the screen and opens another. An Introduction to Sign Language.
ON THE SCREEN: A tutorial on how to write in Sanskrit play over a sign language instructional video showing hand movements along with subtitles.
INT. CDC & GENETIC LEGISLATION OVERSIGHT - ATLANTA, GA - DAY
Outside, CONTRUCTION WORKERS work on remodeling the building as a large industrial crane lowers a brand new sign in place with the CDCs newest designation.
SAMANTHA CARR (47) and the new Head of the CDC-GLO. Well dressed with a strong demeanor of professionalism, sits at her desk, on the phone.
SAMANTHA
Yes, sir. Thank you, and congratulations on getting your bill passed.
PRESIDENT ATWELL (48), the countries current leader that inherited the aftermath of a nationwide disaster.
PRESIDENT ATWELL (O.S.)
It was your department’s suggestions and interactions with both parties that got this done.
(MORE)
PRESIDENT ATWELL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
This victory is as much yours as it is mine.
SAMANTHA
Thank you. Goodbye, Mr. President.
Samantha hangs up.
Steven Jaetson enters, approaches the desk and lays down a sealed envelope with Samantha’s name on the front.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
What’s this?
STEVEN
My resignation. I want out of this place. Hell, I wanted out years ago.
SAMANTHA
I know this job hasn’t been easy. You’ve handled it well. If you’re harboring some ill will--
STEVEN
The President felt more comfortable with you in charge, and I supported that decision. My personal feelings are my own.
SAMANTHA
Times change. Jobs and positions change. The people needed a department that could advise the government on how to handle the aftermath.
STEVEN
Yes, a separate department, and an advisory department to the CDC only. The two were never meant to be combined.
SAMANTHA
We adapt to the changes that come over time. The CDC had no choice.
STEVEN
If I had been left in charge of the CDC instead of being asked to join your team after the outbreak, none of--
SAMANTHA
The people after you were more than qualified. This country promised a way to reverse the mutation and couldn’t do it in the time frame given.
STEVEN
I told you that we would be years away from finding a method to reverse the effects. The CDC needed more time.
SAMANTHA
After thirteen years, combining the two departments was the only way to justify keeping the CDC. Are you suggesting that I let it fail, or that I caused it to fail?
Steven walks over to the window, glancing downward toward the streets below.
Two large areas are fenced off, each with a separate group of protestors. On one side, people hold signs reading: “CHILDREN ARE CHILDREN”, “CRUELTY TO THE YOUNG = A CRUEL FUTURE”,
“TREAT YOUR CHILDREN WELL”. On the other side, signs read: “NOT HUMAN, NOT MINE”, “REVELATIONS 13:16-18” and “ONLY HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE GIVEN HUMAN RIGHTS”
STEVEN
All of us should have made better choices. Be more cautious with yours than I was with mine.
Steven exits.
EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - WASHINGTON, D.C. - SAME
Laura and Stacy Schwartz observe the tourists as they approach the front of the grand monument.
LAURA
Know who that is?
STACY
Thomas Jefferson. One of the Founding Fathers of this country.
LAURA
That’s right and how long was he President?
STACY
From March 4th, 1801 to March 4th, 1809.
LAURA
Correct. Do you know what he did with the indigenous population that was here before him?
STACY
The Native Americans?
LAURA
He moved them off their sacred land. Did you also know he was a slave owner? He even knew that slavery was wrong and freed some of the people he kept.
STACY
Why would a person treat others like that?
LAURA
Now that is the big question, isn’t it? Some say he was just a product of his time. Personally, I think he knew one very important thing about human beings.
STACY
What’s that momma?
LAURA
That everybody needs guidance. Somebody to show others their place. To give them purpose. Not just in this world, but in the universe.
A female Eldermite, a human-insect like being from a time unknown, stands in front of Stacy taking the place of her mother.
Segmented eyes with a see-through exoskeleton, tissues submersed in blue blood. Neurons discharge electrical impulses throughout the skull as its long flowing fiber-optic- like hair changes colors.
The creature places her hand upon the child’s shoulder, speaking in her mother’s voice.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Sometimes the best way to do that..
The creature kneels down in front of the child.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Is by controlling them.
The creature’s eyes begin to glow with an intense blue light.
INT. SCHWARTZ RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - SAME
Laura stands outside Stacy’s bedroom. Her eyes glow with a dimly lit blue light. They go back to normal with a blink of her eyes as she moves to face the door.
INT. BEDROOM OF STACY SCHWARTZ - SAME
Stacy awakens startled from the dream to the sound of her mother opening the door.
Laura enters.
LAURA
Up and at’em stinker, or you’ll be late for your field trip. Let’s get a move on.
STACY
I’m awake.
LAURA
Everything OK?
STACY
Just a bad dream.
LAURA
Breakfast is almost ready.
Laura exits.
INT. OFFICE OF STEVEN JAETSON -- SAME
A box filled with folders and office supplies rests in the middle of a cleared desk. Outlines of where picture frames once hung align the walls. A figure of a woman stands in front of a window.
Steven Jaetson enters and walks towards his desk.
JANET
Hello Steven.
STEVEN
Nice of you to come by and see me off.
JANET
You will be missed. Unless you want to go back to the CDC branch. I can make that happen.
STEVEN
How are you able to--
JANET
Samantha asked me to take charge of the CDC Division while she manages the Legislative.
STEVEN
That was fast.
JANET
The new offices should be ready by tomorrow and the center for the database in two weeks.
STEVEN
A legislative committee with a database full of information on children and their families. What could go wrong with that?
JANET
I know this wasn’t the path you intended for the committee to take.
STEVEN
You’re damn straight it isn’t. A society will always be judged on how it treats its citizens.
JANET
We were invaded. Changed against our will.
STEVEN
And the Genetic Registration Act is the way to tell by whom? Yeah, I get it.
JANET
With the new law in place we’ll be able to start gathering--
STEVEN
Listen to yourself.
JANET
It was more than a disease that hit us. We need to be prepared.
STEVEN
There are scientists out there that believe life began and evolved because of viral influences in the environment.
JANET
Not this again.
STEVEN
Who are we or this Government to say this isn’t the next step in our genetic evolution? Maybe being smarter, stronger, and faster is exactly what we need.
JANET
We’re working on a test that will be able to tell us who carries The Enders mutation as a dominant or recessive trait. It’s six months from completion, maybe less.
STEVEN
For what purpose, exactly?
JANET
To bring us closer to what the world wants, a cure.
Steven grabs his box from off his desk and heads towards the office door.
STEVEN
Feels like a stepping stone to a preemptive strike.
Steven stops at the office door entrance.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
For what it’s worth, I wish things had worked out differently between us.
JANET
Until I’m sure my child will be human, I’d make the same decision.
I know.
STEVEN
Steven walks out of the office closing the door behind him. Janet sits down at the empty desk and begins to cry.
INT. CDC AND GENETIC LEGISLATION OVERSIGHT - ATLANTA, GA - LABORATORY - SAME
The room is completely decked out in the most advanced lab equipment money can buy. Centrifuges spin as other vials are being rocked back and forth throughout the lab.
Peter stands in front of a cabinet, looking at an object resting inside.
The lab door opens.
Peter closes the cabinet doors and locks them shut.
Steven Jaetson enters and places his box of memories on a nearby empty seat.
PETER
Steven. I was meaning to get topside before you left. Must’ve gotten distracted. Sorry.
STEVEN
Peter, I just wanted to let you know, if there is anything I can do for you, just call.
PETER
Appreciate it, but I’m needed here. Never thought I’d say that about a government job. You talk to Janet lately?
STEVEN
Saw her a few days ago during the commencement ceremony. How’s that little one of yours?
PETER
Right now, I’d say she’s probably having the time of her life.
School’s visiting the zoo today.
STEVEN
Heard the schools in town started testing.
PETER
They say she’s special.
Peter walks over to a desk, opens a drawer and pulls out a file.
STEVEN
What’s that?
PETER
A DNA test. Haven’t told Laura yet. Stacy, she--
STEVE
Tested positive as an Enders carrier?
PETER
Yeah. Figured we should know. Just in case this Registration Act passes. I’ll never rest until I beat this thing. My newest test results show--
STEVEN
Please, Peter, I no longer work here.
Steven walks back towards the exits as Peter follows. Peter shakes Steven’s hand.
PETER
What are you going to do?
STEVEN
Figured I would live a nice, quiet, self-reflective life for a little while.
PETER
Nothing wrong with that my friend. Just stay in touch.
STEVEN
Don’t worry about Stacy, she’s strong. With you and Laura by her side
Steven grabs the remnants of his past and exits.
EXT. ZOO ATLANTA - ATLANTA, GA - AFTERNOON
SCHOOL TEACHERS move around a large group of children, trying to maintain order in the parking lot outside the Atlanta Zoo.
MARY SNODGRASS (26), conservatively dressed, brunette, tall and teacher at Inman Middle School.
MARY
Alright everyone settle down please.
The children continue to talk to one another.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS (67), well dressed with a serious demeanor approaches the group.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
You heard your teacher, everyone settle down now.
The group quiets down quickly.
MARY
Everyone keep in mind that this is still a school-sanctioned event. So be on your best behavior, stick together, and try to have as much fun as possible.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
OK everyone, let’s form two single file lines. Beginning here.
Stacy and her friend JESSICA, get in line.
JESSICA
You excited?
STACY
I’ve never been here.
JESSICA
It’s amazing. You’ll love it.
FREDDIE YOUNG (12), thin, glasses, a sheepish looking boy, approaches the line.
JOSH SAMPSON (14), large and brutish in appearance, pushes Freddie out of line.
JOSH
Thanks for the cuts.
ADAM JONES (14) and DERRICK YATES (14), same in appearance and friends to Josh, join him in line.
Stacy witnesses the incident.
ADAM
It’s good that you know your place.
STACY
Freddie, over here. Join us.
Freddie hurries to the other line.
FREDDIE
Thanks, Stacy.
STACY
Don’t worry about them. Maybe if they weren’t jerks all the time, they would actually pass the fifth grade for once.
INT. ZOO ATLANTA - GORILLA HOLDING AREA - SAME
TAZ, a large, male, Silverback gorilla, paces anxiously in an enclosure located in the Gorilla holding area.
A MALE KEEPER sits at a desk observing the gorilla’s behavior. A FEMALE KEEPER walks up behind him.
FEMALE KEEPER
How goes it?
MALE KEEPER
Not bad.
FEMALE KEEPER
What is up with Taz?
MALE KEEPER
Not sure. Doc had him in there resting after his last exam.
Taz quickens his pace back and forth while pounding his chest.
FEMALE KEEPER
He’s uptight about something.
Taz walks up to the door leading to the room where the keepers are. He beats on the door, each strike harder than the last.
MALE KEEPER
Probably just wants out to flirt with the girls.
The door moves more and more with each strike.
FEMALE KEEPER
Better call the doc and see if he’s cleared to go outside.
Male Keeper picks up a phone located on the desk.
INT. ZOO ATLANTA - PICNIC AREA - SAME
Stacy and the rest of the children congregate in the picnic area.
A SECOND GROUP of children ranging from the ages of five to twelve years old, walk into the enclosure.
Some are dressed in regular clothing while others wear shirts that say: “Ennoble: Where advanced education is the key to advanced knowledge.”
Multiple ADULTS accompany the group.
SANDRA JOHNSON (26), typical schoolmarm, conservatively dressed and teacher at Ennoble, addresses the children.
SANDRA
OK class, let’s go get some food then come back here and be sure to wash up after you eat. Is that understood?
CLASS
(in unison) Yes Miss Johnson.
Josh, Adam and Derrick, notice the group.
One of the boys wearing an Ennoble school shirt takes a seat alone at a bench.
JOSH
What’s that? Ennoble.
ADAM
One of those special charter schools, I think.
JOSH
Charter school?
DERRICK
Yeah. It’s one of those schools for the freaks.
JOSH
No way. Seriously?
DERRICK
Let’s go ask the freak sitting alone over there.
JOSH
Sounds like fun to me.
The three boys head over toward the child.
Stacy notices the bullies’ behavior and walks towards the group.
INT. ZOO ATLANTA - GORILLA HOLDING AREA - SAME
Taz continues to pound on the door leading inside as The Male Keeper talks on the phone.
MALE KEEPER
Thanks doc, might want to hurry.
The Male Keeper hangs up the phone.
MALE KEEPER (CONT'D)
Doc says to keep him in. He’s showing up with a sedative.
Taz moves to the other side of his enclosure. He runs at the door and slams his body into the massive metal structure. On the other side, a single bolt falls out of one of the hinges and rolls towards the two Keepers.
FEMALE KEEPER
He’s about to bust down the damn door.
Male Keeper walks over to a cabinet and pulls out a black hand-held tranquilizer pistol.
Taz backs up again to the other side of his enclosure.
FEMALE KEEPER (CONT'D)
Screw this!
Female Keeper presses a button opening the door to the outside enclosure.
Taz pauses for a moment, sees the open door and casually strolls through.
FEMALE KEEPER (CONT'D)
See? All he wanted was out.
The two Keepers laugh.
Security monitors behind the men display video feeds of Taz outside staring at the entrance he just walked through.
DR. PAULA SHEPHARD (38) Veterinarian, wearing regular clothes under a doctor’s white lab coat, enters.
DR. SHEPHARD
What’s going on guys?
Taz charges toward the entrance at full speed, slamming the full weight of his 370 pound frame into the door, blasting it off its hinges.
The door flies into the Female keeper, knocking her unconscious.
Male Keeper aims the pistol at Taz.
Taz grabs the man’s arm, and seizes the pistol.
DR. SHEPHARD (CONT'D)
Oh boy.
MALE KEEPER
OK big guy. Careful now. Just put it down.
Taz wraps both his hands around the gun and points it directly at the Keeper.
MALE KEEPER (CONT'D)
Taz, put it down.
Taz pulls the trigger.
The dart hits The Keeper in the chest, sending him backwards into Dr. Shephard.
Taz tosses the gun into the gorilla enclosure and pushes the two men to the floor as he exits the building.
EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS OF SENATOR KEVIN SCHEFIELD - ATLANTA, GA - SAME
SENATOR KEVIN SCHEFIELD (57), a typical politician/southern gentleman, stands behind a podium in front of a large group of supporters.
TIMOTHY SULKA (28), a “suit and tie” man and Campaign Manager to Senator Schefiled, stands behind the man alongside Jedidiah.
TIMOTHY
The Senator is really impressed with all the work you’ve been doing for us Jed. He wants to talk to you after the speech. Mind sticking around for a little bit after?
JED
Of course.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
My friends, we have now seen a shift in ideals and perspective. A perspective that is rooted in ignorance. This; DNA Registration Act; is nothing more than another step towards inequality and bigotry.
Voices from the crowd yell and cheer in agreement. Shouts of “NOT FAIR” and “HELP THE CHILDREN” ring out among the crowd.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD (CONT'D)
Because of rumor and conjecture of The Enders virus’s origins, people question whether or not these children are human.
Again the crowd cheers with yells of “MORE RESEARCH, MORE UNDERSTANDING” hail from the group.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD (CONT'D)
Until recently, the only thing that kept this fear at bay was the equal divide between both Democrats and Republicans. Then along comes Senator Knowels.
The sound of boos and mumbling overcomes the Senator’s supporters.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD (CONT'D)
A man who rose to power basing his campaign on people’s fears and prejudices.
The audience cheers.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD (CONT'D)
Miseducation and misinformation.
The crowd grows louder.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD (CONT'D)
Now he and others like him are a step closer to declaring war on families. Families like mine and my granddaughter. I promise this, I will not- nor will I ever- swap my moral beliefs for fear.
APPLAUSE
SENATOR SCHEFIELD (CONT'D)
Too many of my party have been misguided by Senator Knowels. I now feel tossed aside from the Democratic Party that I once admired.
The crowd goes silent.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD (CONT'D)
As of today, I am stopping my campaign for State Senate and instead I declare my run as the next Independent Presidential Candidate.
The crowd bursts into an overwhelming show of support, chanting the Senator’s name.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD (CONT'D)
Together we will stop this mentality of cruelty to our young and ensure our future with hope, kindness, and respect. God bless the United States of America.
The crowd stands and cheers for the Senator as he steps away from the podium.
Senator Schefield, Timothy, Jedidiah, and a few other members of the Senior Campaign Staff follow close behind.
INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS OF SENATOR KEVIN SCHEFIELD - ATLANTA, GA - SAME

Senator Schefield approaches his office, turns around, and addresses the group.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
OK everyone. We have a lot of work to do starting tomorrow, so go home, get some rest, and be prepared to work hard tomorrow.
We’ve got a Presidency to win.
The Senator opens the double doors and walks into his office. Tim and Jed enter as Jed shuts the doors behind them.

Senator Schefield takes a seat behind his desk. Tim and Jed take a seat in the two chairs in front.
TIMOTHY
So I take it the meeting went well?
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
The two Independents bow out of their campaigns tomorrow. They’re announcing an endorsement for us with a promise to convince their supporters to do the same.
TIMOTHY
That’s fantastic news sir.
JED
The should place us 12 points within Senator Knowels and President Atwell in the poles.
The Senator leans back comfortably in his chair with a look of a cat that just swallowed the canary.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
That’s not all, everyone is putting all the leftover money from their campaigns into our SuperPac.
TIMOTHY
An Independent with a shot to win The Presidency. Thought I’d never see the day.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
All thanks to Jed.
JED
All I did was crunch the numbers and gauged the mood of the average voter, sir.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
That’s a load of crap. Tim, I swear my right hand to God, each one said that anything less would be detrimental to true American decency.
JED
Well sir, I--
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
They said after seeing the data, it was like angels singing in unison. And after talking to you, it was as if you were inside their heads.
JED
I wouldn’t exactly say that sir.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
You have your hands on the pulse of the people. Which is why I want you on my staff, full time. You’ll be working with Tim on strategy and statistics.
JED
I really don’t know what to say.
TIMOTHY
I do. Welcome aboard.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
You sure your family won’t mind us stealing you from them?
JED
My family is very supportive sir. They’ll be happy to hear the news.
SENATOR SCHEFIELD
So that’s a yes, then? Good. Every bit of research and analysis we come up with, I want your eyes on it.
JED
Yes. Yes sir. Thank you for the opportunity. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some campaigning I still need to do. Found a voter I think I can swing our way.
SENATOR SCHEFFIELD
My God, son. Are you always working?
JED
Every vote helps, sir.
INT. ZOO ATLANTA - PICNIC AREA - SAME
SHAWN CORBIN (12), a sheepish daydreamer, sits alone in the picnic area as the three bullies approach.
The boys surround Shawn at the table.
JOSH
Hey. Hello.
SHAWN JOSH
What’s your name?
SHAWN
Shawn. What’s yours?
JOSH
My friends and I here were wondering something, Shawn.
SHAWN
What is it you want to know?
EXT. ZOO ATLANTA - GORILLA DECK AREA - SAME
Alarms BLARE while a RECORDED VOICE broadcasts on loud speakers: ESACAPED ANIMAL. DO NOT APPROACH. PLEASE SEEK IMMEDEATE INSIDE SHELTER WHILE OUR KEEPERS HANDLE THE SITUATION.
Visitors take cover as Taz DASHES through the group towards the picnic area.
Dr. Shephard, along with the Male Keeper, now armed with a tranquilizer rifle, keep chase.
The Male Keeper takes aim and fires off a tranquilizer dart, missing the beast.
Damn it.
MALE KEEPER
The Keeper grabs the walkie from his belt.
MALE KEEPER (CONT'D)
He’s heading toward the picnic area.
EXT. ZOO ATLANTA - PICNIC AREA - SAME
The bullies surround the boy, slowly moving closer and closer toward him. Teachers from both schools appear distracted by the groups of clamoring kids.
JOSH
Your school, it’s for, you know.
SHAWN
What do you mean?
JOSH
You know. The different ones?
SHAWN
Different ones?
JOSH
Freaks, you freak.
ADAM
The marked ones.
DERRICK
Yeah, the unwanted.
JOSH
Are your parents still around, or do you live there also?
DERRICK
Bet his parents left him, heard that happens all the time.
Stacy approaches.
The three boys get up from the table and face her.
STACY
You three need to grow up.
JOSH
Really? Pretty sure we’re more grown up than you.
Sounds of people panicking cry out in the background.
STACY
Just because you’re a couple of years older and behind as many grade levels, doesn’t make you more grown up. Just means you need to learn how to read.
Josh, Adam and Derrick get up from the table and surround Stacy.
ADAM
Little girl with a big mouth.
Taz runs through the picnic area and up to Adam and Derrick, pushing them to the ground.
The two classes run from the area.
Shawn grabs Stacy’s hand as they run away and join the class.
Taz focuses his attention on Josh as the other two boys scurry.
Josh jumps over to the other side of the picnic table, placing it between him and the large primate.
Taz and the bully circle the table, eyes locked on each other.
MARY
Somebody help him!
Taz hurls the picnic table over Josh’s head. He approaches the child, knuckles pounding the ground with every step he takes.
The Male Keeper and Dr. Shephard make their way through the large crowd.
The Male Keeper takes aim.
DR. SHEPHARD
Wait, he’s too close. You hit Taz with that, he could flinch and send the kid flying. You really want to risk it?
Taz moves up to less than a foot away from the boy, paralyzed with fear.
MALE KEEPER
Unless you got a better idea.
Stacy stands in front of the crowd of onlookers. A voice rings out from all around her.
VOICE
Help the child.
Stacy looks around.
VOICE (CONT'D)
You know what to do.
Stacy starts to head towards Taz.
SHAWN
What are you doing?
STACY
It’s OK. I’ll be fine.
Stacy walks out into The Keeper’s line of sight.
MALE KEEPER
What the hell?
Stacy rests her hand upon Taz’s shoulder.
STACY
Taz. It’s OK. He’s not going to hurt anyone. You’ve made your point.
Taz turns around, looks at Stacy with an expression of calm and affection, then refocuses his attention toward Josh. Taz moves closer to Josh’s face.
STACY (CONT'D)
If you don’t go back to your enclosure, your keepers are going to have to hurt you. Please, I don’t want to see that.
Taz lets out a massive dominant ROAR.
Josh faints. A patch of moisture begins to form on the front of his pants. A separate and more discolored spot appears on the backside.
STACY (CONT'D)
Now that’s gross.
Taz grunts.
Stacy gently takes his hand and escorts him over to The Keeper.
STACY (CONT'D)
I’ll see you again someday. I promise.
Taz places his forehead upon Stacy’s and strokes the side of her cheek gently with the back of his hand.
Stacy takes Taz’s hand and places it into the palm of The Male Keeper.
STACY (CONT'D)
He’ll behave now. No need to use your rifle.
MALE KEEPER
Thank you.
As Taz, The Male Keeper and Dr. Shephard head back toward the gorilla enclosure, Taz stops, looks back, raises his hands and signs the words: Behave yourself, my friend.
Stacy answers in sign-language: You also, friend. The three continue back to the enclosure.
Shawn walks up to Stacy.
SHAWN
How did you do that?
STACY
I have no idea.
INT. MCCORD RESIDENCE - ATLANTA, GA - SAME
On top of a bookshelf, pictures of William McCord and his family over the last thirteen years stretch from end to end.
Below and on the left and right sides of the bookshelf; various books on genetics and viruses written by William.
In the middle section: a framed obituary showing the passing of his wife, Jennifer McCord along with various knick-knacks, candles among pictures of her and the family.
WILLIAM MCCORD sits on the couch watching the evening news.
TV #1
Senator Knowels today praised the passing of The Genetic Registration Act and vows to uphold the new law at any cost. In national news, Steven Jaetson, former CDC Director and head of the Genetic Legislation Oversight Committee, resigned today saying--
The doorbell rings.
William mutes the TV, gets up and answers the door. Jedidiah Saunders stands on the other side.
JED
Hello, I represent the campaign to re-elect Senator Kevin Schefield. Is there a Mr. William McCord here?
WILLIAM
Yes, that’s me.
JED
Excellent. May I get you to spare a few moments of your time?
WILLIAM
Sure, why don’t you come on in and have a seat. Anyone representing Senator Schefield is ok in my book.
Jed steps into the house.
JED
Thank you.
William sits back down in his chair as Jed takes a seat on the couch in front of him.
WILLIAM
My wife and I voted for him last election. You can count on our vote this time as well.
JED
Thank you. We feel that people like Senator Knowels do not represent values that are appropriate for the future of our children.
WILLIAM
I agree. People who use fear to drum up votes and pass legislation worry me.
JED
We believe all of us should be focusing on understanding. To be completely honest, there is another reason why I’m here.
Jed reaches into his jacket pocket.
William starts to tense up a little. Now a little unsure about the strangers intentions.
WILLIAM
What’s going on? What are you--
JED
Sorry, let me explain. We met a long time ago.
William looks at Jed, trying to remember his face.
JED (CONT'D)
It was back when I had dreadlocks and a beard.
William smiles.
WILLIAM
Holy shit. The homeless man. Now this is a surprise. I never thought I’d see you again. Jed was it? At least that’s what the doctor said.
JED
Same here. Dr. Montgomery told me who was taking care of my hospital stay. When I saw your name on the list for our campaign’s meet and greets, I had to see if it was you. I hope you don’t mind.
Jed pulls out a plain white envelope from his pocket.
WILLIAM
Of course not. You’re obviously doing better. No longer homeless I take it.
JED
After I left the hospital, I decided it was time to get my life back in order.
Jed hands over an envelope to William.
William opens the envelope. Inside, a check made out to William from Jed in a large amount.
WILLIAM
What’s this?
JED
That should cover all the out of pocket expenses you had to pay for my stay in the hospital. No more, no less.
WILLIAM
I can’t accept this.
JED
After I left the hospital, I went out and saw just exactly how inhuman people could be.
WILLIAM
How so?
FLASHBACK
An image of a WOMAN holding a paper-bag being chased by three BRUTISH-LOOKING MEN down an alley.
JED (V.O.)
There was a woman. She was trying to get back home to her son. Three men were harassing her. I had to intervene.
Jed raises his hand towards the men as an INTENSE BLUE LIGHT shines from his eye sockets.
END FLASHBACK
WILLIAM
What happened to them?
JED
The woman was knocked unconscious before I could help. By the time she woke up and we headed back.
Jed pauses with a solemn look on his face.
JED (CONT'D)
We couldn’t make it back in time to help him.
Jed notices the picture of The President handing a document to William rests on a mantle. The document reads: For Outstanding Service and Research.
JED (CONT'D)
You still work for the CDC?
WILLIAM
Not anymore.
Jed notices the shrine dedicated to Jennifer. A look of sadness overcomes his face.
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
My wife Jennifer.
JED
How’d she--
WILLIAM
Cancer. A little less than a year now.
JED
My condolences.
WILLIAM
What happened to the woman?
JED
I married her.
The front door opens.
DELILAH MCCORD (28), daughter to William, cheerful with a confident demeanor and pregnant enters.
DELILAH
Hey dad.
WILLIAM
Jed, this is my daughter Delilah.
JED
Pleasure to meet you.
DELILAH
Nice to meet you. How do you and my father know each other?
JED
You can say we ran into each other a while back.
DELILAH
How so?
WILLIAM
Jed’s the man I almost ran over. Back on the day of The Enders breakout.
DELILAH
Really? Wow, last we heard was that you just got up and walked out of the hospital.
JED
If I caused you and your family undue stress during that time--
DELILAH
Good to know you’re OK.
Delilah grabs her stomach.
DELILAH (CONT'D)
Oh boy. She’s really kicking today.
Delilah takes hold of one of Jed's hands.
DELILAH (CONT'D)
Here, feel.
Jed tenses up.
WILLIAM
Maybe Jed doesn’t want to.
Delilah places Jed's hand on her stomach. FLASHBACK:
An image of two human-insect like creatures, similar to the one in Stacy’s dream, flash in Jedidiah’s memory.
One male, the other, a pregnant female.
The unborn child reaches out to its father, putting its hand next to the father’s from inside the womb.
END FLASHBACK
JED
It’s OK.
Delilah giggles.
DELILAH
She really likes you. I’ve never felt her behave like this before.
JED
My children were the same way. I could just be around my wife and they would start kicking. Twins.
DELILAH
How did she get any sleep with you in the same bed?
JED
The couch and I became old friends real fast. I’m afraid I must be going. Other houses and people to visit.
Jed heads towards the front door.
WILLIAM
Stop by anytime, Jed. It’s good to know you’re doing OK.
JED
It was nice meeting you Delilah. Mr. McCord. Maybe we’ll all meet again someday.
Jed exits.

Hello Mr. And Mrs. Schwartz, they’re waiting for you in the Principal’s office. Go right on in.
Laura and Peter walk into the office.
Principal Marcus, sits behind his desk while Stacy sits in one of the two chairs in front.
STACY
Mom, Dad.
PETER
Hey sweetie.
LAURA
We got here as soon as we could, Principal Marcus.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
Please, have a seat.
LAURA
We heard on the radio that there was an incident with an escaped gorilla?
STACY
You guys should have been there. Taz was incredible.
PETER
Taz?
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
Stacy, why don’t you get your things, get ready for your parents and wait outside the office.
STACY
Yes sir.
Stacy exits.
PETER
What exactly happened?
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
One of the male silverbacks escaped from its enclosure and ran amok through the zoo.
LAURA
Yeah, we heard that much on the radio on the way over.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
Taz, the gorilla, came close to seriously assaulting a few of our students.
PETER
How bad was it?
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
A few bumps and bruises. The only thing truly damaged was a child’s pride.
PETER
I’m not exactly following here. How is our daughter involved?
Principal Marcus turns around to reveal footage of the incident playing on YOUTube.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
He seemed to understand her. What she wanted him to do, he did it.
Peter and Laura watch as Stacy calms the gorilla down.
LAURA
My God.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
If it wasn’t for her, that boy would’ve been ripped apart. The local news outlets have been calling, asking about her.
PETER
We’d appreciate it if you kept our girl out of the spotlight.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
Her face is out there, won’t take long before the world finds out who she is.
LAURA
And we’ll handle it when it does. This is an issue we need to discuss as a family first.
PETER
We would prefer people not jumping to conclusions about Stacy, Principal Marcus. With everything happening to children nowadays--
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
Let me reassure you both that we take hate crimes very seriously here. I’ve seen her placement test results. Her IQ is through the roof. Has Stacy ever shown signs of being an Ender’s child before?
PETER
No. As far as we’ve seen, she’s just gifted.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
There was another school that had a student of theirs involved in all of this. We had to exchange some personal information. They may be contacting you later.
PETER
Which one was it?
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
Ennoble.
PETER
The new charter school that opened a few months ago.
PRINCIPAL MARCUS
Ennoble’s getting more pressure than us for a comment. I would expect someone from there to reach to you by then. We’ve already planned an assembly for tomorrow about this for the students.

Thank you Principal Marcus. Peter, I think we should be going now.

DR. SHEPHARD
Ever since we got him back here. We’re still trying to repair the door to his original space.

Keep him in here. This will do just fine. We’ll be setting up a lab in here. Witnesses said he used sign language with the girl.
DR. SHEPHARD
A deaf couple noticed it.
SAMANTHA
How long have you been teaching him?
DR. SHEPHARD
He was part of a study in his childhood but they stopped that years ago. Said he never took to it. Will he be OK?

That’s no longer your concern doc.
Dr. Shephard starts to leave.

RUSSIAN PHYSICIAN #1
A week ago he was just a farmer, now he’s a science experiment.
RUSSIAN PHYSICIAN #2
Is it true what they say? He’s the first?
RUSSIAN PHYSICIAN #1
I don’t put faith in rumors. Only what I’m told. I suggest you do the same.
The First Physician pulls a tray out from a cabinet, then another.
RUSSIAN PHYSICIAN #1 (CONT'D)
Don’t forget, what we do here today is to help the rest of us.
The First Physician opens a second cabinet and fills the tray with various scalpels, a chest opener and a circular bone saw.
RUSSIAN PHYSICIAN #2
True, but I would be more comfortable if he was at least legally dead first.
The Second Physician prepares a syringe as he walks toward the patient.
ALARMS
RUSSIAN PHYSICIAN #2 (CONT'D)
I know he’s about to be, but still.
The Man goes into an extreme seizure.
All electronic equipment in the room shuts down, the room goes dark.
EMERGENCY LIGHTS
The same blue light emanates from all around.
Suddenly, with extreme force, the two men go sailing across the room. Their bodies take out lab equipment as they slam up against the double-door entrance.
INT. HALLWAY - SIBERIAN MEDICAL FACILITY - SAME
The blue light continues to shine through the gaps around the entrance.
Sounds of clothing and flesh being ripped apart. A pool of blood seeps underneath the doors.
THE END
