1   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
A silhouetted man stands in a well lit hallway staring into a dark room.
He is holding a CUP in his hand.
He flips the light switch repeatedly, rhythmically, on-and- off four times. But the light won't turn on.
He counts to four and then tries again, flipping the switch four times.
The dark room is the kitchen. It has a small table, and is well organized.
Even with the main lights off, the kitchen still glows with a bright nightlight plugged into an outlet near the sink across the room.
He won't go in.
MATCH CUT TO:
2   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Inside another room, black except for the nightlight, light shines through the crack of the door.
The door opens and the silhouetted man is there, holding the CUP.
He reaches in and turns the light on and off, flipping the switch rhythmically, counting off four times quietly.
The light remains on and he steps in.
He plugs his PHONE into a PHONE CHARGER that is already in the bathroom.
His PHONE battery is full.
The background of his phone is an old blue toy car. He goes to the sink and looks into the mirror.
This is Daniel Clay. A clean-shaven man suffering from OCD that manifests in a number of ways, but most debilitating is his phobia of the dark.
Daniel turns the nozzle on-and-off four times, counting.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 2.
He leaves it on for four seconds, counting and then fills up his cup for four seconds. He lets the water run for four seconds and then fills his cup for four seconds until it is full.
3   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
In the tidy and minimal bedroom, with all the lights on, Daniel approaches the bed holding his full CUP and PHONE.
He puts his CUP down first, then his PHONE.
He makes sure to align the CUP on the corner of the table, rounding the edge with his finger to make sure it is perfect.
He then plugs in his PHONE to a CHARGER and aligns it with the corner.
He walks to the main light switch of the room and flips it off-and-on four times, rhythmically. But he's nervous when the room hastily darkens.
He hurries to the bed and tucks himself in just so, making sure the blankets are pulled down tightly on all sides of him while wrapping his feet with blanket tightly. It's like armor.
He looks around the dark room to make sure nothing is there. He grabs his PHONE that is plugged in.
He looks through a few security camera feeds.
4   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The front door is locked and closed. The couch is empty. Nothing is moving in the well lit room.
5   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
The kitchen is motionless, but very dark.
6   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT
The hallway, lined with FRAMED PHOTOS, leading to the bedroom is clear and well lit.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 3.
7   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daniel grabs the REMOTE and turns the TV on. It doesn't matter what is on, but he changes the channel four times. He turns the volume way down.
He reaches to his table-side light. There is a FRAMED PHOTO, and it contains a STOCK PHOTO of a happy family with two kids; it shows the size and barcode.
He turns the table-side-light off-and-on, counting to four, leaving it off.
Even with the main lights off, the bedroom still glows with a bright nightlight plugged into an outlet and the bright TV.
He nervously looks around the room. There is nothing there.
Heâ€™s finally able to close his eyes and rest.
CUT TO:
8   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
From pitch black, inside the fridge, the fridge door opens. Daniel opens it and closes it rhythmically, four times.
Everything is perfectly organized, in rows and facing forward.
He takes one of the lined up orange juices and one of the lined up yogurt cups.
He brings forward the rest of the orange juices and yogurts to be in the front of the fridge.
He sits at the table with the orange juice and yogurt along with a spoon. He aligns the juice, yogurt and spoon along the edges of the table.
Then he begins to enjoy his meal.
9   EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - DAY
Daniel opens the front door of his house, looking cautiously at the world. He checks back and forth repeatedly and only then steps outside.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 4.
It's a quaint multi-bedroom house with a small yard leading up to a quiet suburban street. There are similar family- houses lining both sides of the street.
He steps to the edge of the property beside the mailbox, and without stepping off of his property, he leans out to open the mail box...and close it...four times and checks his mail.
He sees his neighbor's OLD SEDAN pull into the driveway. Daniel walks over, careful to only use the walkways.
10   EXT. MEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Mel (75, a sweet old man, frail and hunched with disorganized thoughts) is carrying a BROWN BAG OF GROCERIES from trunk of his OLD SEDAN.
Daniel rushes over.
DANIEL
Morning, Mel! I can help.
MEL
Thanks, Daniel. The bag boy helped me get them to the car.
DANIEL
Oh that was nice of him.
MEL
Yes it was.
Daniel looks at six BROWN BAGS in the trunk.
MEL (CONT'D)
The two on the left are your groceries.
DANIEL
Thanks. I can get the rest for you.
MEL
That would be great.
Mel, carrying one BROWN BAG OF GROCERIES walks into his house.
Daniel, still at the trunk, aligns the BROWN BAG OF GROCERIES into a straight line, and then he grabs two.
As he does this, a LARGE CAN OF BEANS rolls down the driveway.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 5.
Daniel puts the two BROWN BAGS back down in the trunk and tries to catch the LARGE CAN OF BEANS but it rolls into the street.
Daniel stops and stares at it. It's very close, but beyond his reach. He looks disappointed in himself.
Daniel carries two BROWN BAGS into the house and looks at the MEZUZAH on the exterior door frame of the house as he passes.
11   INT. MEL'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Six BROWN BAGS are on Mel's table.
Mel is haphazardly emptying the contents of one BROWN BAG.
Daniel enters carrying the last BROWN BAG. He has trouble putting the bag on the table because of the disorder.
DANIEL
Where can I put this down?
MEL
Anywhere.
Struggling to put it on the disorderly table, he puts it on the clean counter and lines the BROWN BAG with the edge.
Daniel opens Mel's fridge...four times.
DANIEL
Can I...you mind if I move some things around?
MEL
Oh you don't have to--
DANIEL
I kinda do.
MEL
Okay.
Daniel takes a PHONE CHARGER out of his pocket, plugs it into the wall and charges his PHONE.
Daniel sits on the floor and puts things in the fridge in order. The sauces with the sauces. The meats with the meats. The drinks with the drinks. The veggies with the veggies...
It takes him a while, he doesn't even notice he's alone in the kitchen until he looks up.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 6.
DANIEL
Mel? You want to come see?
Mel slowly walks back in.
MEL
Looks really good. Really good, Daniel. Thank you.
DANIEL
It's easy.
Daniel grabs a box that says YAHRZEIT on it. He can tell from the images on the box that they are candles. On top of the box is an assortment of BATTERIES.
MEL
Need anything?
DANIEL
No. I'm good.
MEL
Food? Batteries? There's a storm.
DANIEL
I heard.
Daniel puts the YAHRZEIT BOX along with the BATTERIES on a shelf beside LIGHT BULBS. He carefully makes sure the edges are all in alignment.
Daniel looks at the LIGHT BULBS.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Actually, would you mind if I had a light bulb?
MEL
Do you want a couple?
Daniel laughs off the silly kindness of Mel.
DANIEL
No. Just the one I think.
MEL
Okay.
DANIEL
Alright. I'll see ya. Let me know if you need anything.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 7.
With his LIGHT BULB, Daniel unplugs his PHONE CHARGER from the wall, and looks down at the screen. The Old Blue Toy Car and full battery.
MEL
Are you okay?
DANIEL
I just like to keep my phone at full charge.
Daniel puts his PHONE in his pocket and leaves.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
See ya, Mel.
12   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - EVENING
Daniel, with TWO FLASHLIGHTS blaring around him to keep him out of the dark, stands on a stool and replaces the LIGHT BULB in the kitchen.
The light instantly shines on him and he enjoys it. His phone rings across the room. (jarring)
Daniel hurries down off the stool and rushes to his PHONE as it CHARGES in the wall.
The call is from HAROLD (WORK)
Daniel answers on speakerphone, keeping the phone charging.
DANIEL
Hey, Harold?
HAROLD (PHONE)
Daniel. Where are you?
DANIEL
I'm at home.
HAROLD (PHONE)
You're supposed to be at work. I've got you on evening shift.
DANIEL
I thought that was a mistake. I thought we talked about this. I can't work at night.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 8.
HAROLD (PHONE)
So, you saw your name and didn't tell me. Look, even if we had an understanding, sometimes I forget. And you didn't remind me, so now it's on you that we're short- staffed.
DANIEL
I don't know what to tell you.
HAROLD (PHONE)
...
...
DANIEL
HAROLD (PHONE)
I gotta let you go.
DANIEL
Okay call me back--
HAROLD (PHONE)
Daniel. Your fired, man.
DANIEL
What? That's...crazy. You can't do that! I have a MEDICAL CONDITION! You can't fire me for not working at night! You can't! Harold!
HAROLD!
Daniel spazzes in his kitchen. Knocking things over. He pulls his PHONE from the wall.
A neighbor family having dinner watches Daniel's outburst through the window.
Daniel shuts the curtain angrily and plops onto the floor. He takes a moment to collect himself.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Harold?
He looks at his PHONE. The call is over. All he sees is the photo of the old blue toy car.
The dangling CHARGING CABLE swings beside him.
He plugs his PHONE back into the CHARGER then sets it upon the counter, using his finger to make sure it is lined up.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 9.
He begins picking up items from the floor and neatly putting back what isn't broken, and sweeping broken items up into little piles.
He tries to hide how upset he is. He coughs and it becomes a coughing fit until he is able to calm himself, taking deep breaths in and out.
13   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BATHROOM - LATER
Daniel is in the shower. Steam rises beyond the curtain.
He shuts the shower off...then turns it back on. Then off. Then on. Then off. Then on. Then off.
He pulls the TOWEL down from the curtain rod.
He opens the curtain and has the TOWEL wrapped around him.
He realigns all of his shower items just so. Very particularly, he rearranges the nozzles to face forward, wiping any excess water away.
14   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Daniel is comfortably, tightly tucked into bed. The TV is on. All of his things, his CUP of water, his PHONE is CHARGING, his REMOTE...they are placed around him and arranged just so.
He notices the flash of lightning beyond the curtain. The thunder gently rolls in.
Alerts sound on his phone. (jarring)
He looks on his PHONE: Severe Weather Alert
Another bright flash beyond the curtain...not so scary until a quick crackle and a pounding thunder reverberate the house.
The rain begins outside.
Daniel grabs the REMOTE and turns up the volume on the television.
The lights dim for a moment...the rolling brown-out.
Daniel tries to tuck himself into the covers just a little bit more snug.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 10.
And then, with a simultaneous crack of lightning and burst of thunder, the house goes pitch black except for the faintest light from the powerless world outside
We can hear Daniel breathe nervously. Panicked. As lightning constantly flashes and a stream of thunder rolls along.
Alerts sound on his phone. (jarring)
In the dark, he grabs his lit up PHONE. His face is illuminated by the screen.
He exits the messages and looks at the photo of the old blue toy car.
DANIEL
(quietly, to himself) S--T--O--P.
He uses his PHONE FLASHLIGHT to shine around the room, making sure he's safe in the house.
Once safe. He turns the PHONE FLASHLIGHT off and on again, rhythmically four times while speaking quietly to himself, very nervous.
DANIEL (CONT'D) S--T--O--P.
He shines the light toward the door as he steps out of bed. He opens the door and shines it into the dark hallway.
15   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
The PHONE FLASHLIGHT shines from the hallway into the kitchen as Daniel makes his way from the bedroom.
He is constantly shining the PHONE FLASHLIGHT in various directions, nervous of what could be around him in the dark. He coughs, filling with panic.
He shines the light into a small cardboard box on a shelf. In it are two FLASHLIGHTS, some TEA CANDLES and MATCHES.
He turns on his other FLASHLIGHTS. He may be in the dark, but there is a white glow all around him from the FLASHLIGHTS.
16   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel sits on his couch.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 11.
He opens his bright LAPTOP on the coffee table in front of him, alongside the FLASHLIGHTS that point straight up and the TEA CANDLES all illuminating the room.
Flashes of lightning and rolling thunder still shine through the dark curtains.
He puts a DVD into his LAPTOP and it starts playing. He turns around and looks into the dark hallway.
He quickly shines a flashlight into the darkness.
DANIEL
Hello?
The light reveals nothing there; just the hallway as usual. He folds the blanket that laid across the back of the couch
just so and tucks it tightly under the cushions.
He lays down, and snuggles himself tightly in just so.
He is as comfortable as he can be in the glow of a LAPTOP, CELL PHONE FLASHLIGHT, TWO FLASHLIGHTS and the remaining TEA CANDLES.
He closes his eyes.
17   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Daniel is asleep, still snugly tucked into the blanket on the couch.
Morning light shines hazily through the curtains. The LAPTOP is dead. The FLASHLIGHTS are dead. The TEA
CANDLES, except one are burnt to a puddle...and the final wick extinguishes itself in the melted wax with a hiss.
Daniel's eyes gently open.
He takes stock of where he is.
He reaches to the end table and tries to turn on the LAMP.
One click. It doesn't turn on. A second click...a third...a fourth.
The power is still out.
Worried, he reaches for his PHONE. It, too, is drained dead.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 12.
18   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel is rummaging under the sink looking for batteries or candles...anything.
He is struggling to maintain any order.
He takes things out haphazardly only to gently replace them.
He finds one ROTTEN BATTERY deep under the sink cabinet. He's let down. It won't work for anything.
19   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE GARAGE - MORNING
The garage door opens in bursts, four of them.
Daniel has manually opened the garage door from outside. As light pours in, we see a CAR UNDER A PROTECTIVE COVER. Daniel approaches it reluctantly.
He presses the side of the car.
He pulls the cover off. Daniel's CAR is an economy sedan. He pressed is scratched. He hates that about it.
20   EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
Daniel, in his CAR, pulls up to the gas station. He has a quarter of a tank left.
The power is out.
Daniel parks beside a gas pump not far from a guy laying back on the hood of his SUV parked at another pump.
Daniel rolls down his window then taps the Gas Pump Console but it is blank without power.
GUY ON THE HOOD
Power's out.
Daniel is leaning out his window trying to ignore the man.
GUY ON THE HOOD (CONT'D)
Power's out...
DANIEL
I don't talk to new people.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 13.
Daniel turns away quickly.
GUY ON THE HOOD
Okay. Well, the power's out.
The guys stares curiously at the back of Daniel;s head leaning out his window.
After a moment, Daniel turns back around.
DANIEL
It's a rule; I can't walk anywhere that's not my house or Mel's house.
GUY ON THE HOOD
...Hot lava. I get that.
Daniel nods even though the man isn't exactly getting it.
DANIEL
...What about the Frederick's Station up the road?
GUY ON THE HOOD
Frederick's? That's been gone for like ten years. Whole regions out of power. No gas. No food.
The guy lies back and relaxes...waiting...watching.
Daniel grabs his PHONE CHARGER from his car and opens the car door.
It takes Daniel a second to even swing his foot out of the car, wearing PLASTIC BAGS OVER HIS SHOES. They hang above the ground. After a moment he puts his foot down. Then the next.
Daniel stands up. He closes his door. He takes a deep breath.
GUY ON THE HOOD (CONT'D)
Hot lava.
Yeah.
DANIEL
Daniel, wearing PLASTIC BAGS OVER HIS SHOES, carefully walks to the gas station entrance. He looks at the door. His hand hovers before touching the handle...he grabs it.
21   INT. GAS STATION - MOM
Daniel, wearing PLASTIC BAGS OVER HIS SHOES, walks in and the bells on the door clank. He is holding his PHONE CHARGER.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 14.
ATTENDANT
No gas. Cash only.
Daniel stuffs the PHONE CHARGER back into his pocket. He stares at the attendant. The attendant stares back.
DANIEL
(finds courage, blurting) Do you have any batteries or flashlights? Or candles?
Daniel huffs with success.
ATTENDANT
Incense.
The attendant shows Daniel the INCENSE STICKS. They are not for luminescence.
Daniel shakes his head no.
ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
You should have been here at 6 when we opened. There was a line. People paying big cash.
DANIEL
...
Daniel touches the items on the counter and makes sure they are all aligned with edge and with each other.
ATTENDANT
I sold everything. Two D batteries went for $20.
DANIEL
...Do you have any lighters?...matches?
ATTENDANT
Just the ones in my pocket...$10?
The attendant puts forward the HALF-USED BOOK OF MATCHES. Daniel nods.
ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
Cash only.
Daniel looks in his WALLET. He has $8 CASH. He counts it four times.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 15.
DANIEL
(counts out loud to self) Five. Six, seven, eight. Five. Six, seven, eight. Five. Six, seven, eight. Five. Six, seven, eight.
He looks up at the attendant.
ATTENDANT
No. $10.
Daniel is angry. He starts coughing. The attendant backs away from the glass as Daniel coughs, pulling the matches with him.
DANIEL
I need it. I NEED IT!
Daniel smacks the counter four times.
SMASH CUT TO:
22  EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON
Daniel, wearing PLASTIC BAGS OVER HIS SHOES, is neurotic, pounding on a neighbor's door. Four times.
A 35-year-old, scruffy man answers in lounge wear.
SCRUFFY MAN
Can I help you?
DANIEL
Hey. I live over there.
Daniel points back at his house.
SCRUFFY MAN
I know.
DANIEL
I was wondering if you had any batteries or candles you weren't using.
I don't.
SCRUFFY MAN
DANIEL
Because the power's out, and I have a...medical problem, and I'm, I'm--
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 16.
SCRUFFY MAN
I don't man. I'm sorry.
The scruffy man begins closing the door but Dan interjects.
DANIEL
Okay. Thanks. Do you have any extra flahslights?--
SCRUFFY MAN
You gotta stop knocking on everyone's doors now.
DANIEL
What?
SCRUFFY MAN
No one has any extra shit for you. Okay?
DANIEL
It's a medical thing--
SCRUFFY MAN
I don't know what to tell you.
The man shuts the door.
Daniel steps away from his door, he's trying to stay calm. He walks to the next house.
He knocks four times. He waits. He knocks four more times. He waits.
The scruffy man stands on his porch to yell at Daniel.
SCRUFFY MAN (CONT'D)
Go home!
DANIEL
It's not even your house!
Daniel walks away one house further. The scruffy man watches him.
SCRUFFY MAN
Don't. Don't.
Daniel knocks four times.
The scruffy man stomps toward him.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 17.
Daniel runs away, yelling, hacking cough.
23   EXT. MEL'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
Daniel walks up to Mel's door.
He knocks four times, looking back over his shoulder.
He rips the PLASTIC BAGS OVER HIS SHOES off, tossing them aside.
He notices the MEZUZAH and taps on it four times, checking it out.
Foot steps approach the door.
It's diagonal and Daniel hates that. He tries to nudge it to align it vertically with the door frame, but it won't budge.
Mel opens the door and notices Daniel moving it.
MEL
You don't like my Mezuzah.
DANIEL
Mezuzah?
MEL
Little diagonal thingy with Hebrew prayers in it that you try to fidget with every time you're here.
DANIEL
It's not straight.
MEL
It's not supposed to be.
DANIEL
It should be.
MEL
Who says?
DANIEL
There's rules. It makes me uncomfortable.
MEL
Well. I have a rule that says it's supposed to be diagonal. And, It's not your house, Daniel.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 18.
Mel laughs.
MEL (CONT'D)
You want to come in? I was about to have some applesauce.
Mel, without waiting for Daniel's response, kisses his fingers and taps the MEZUZAH and walks into his house, leaving the door open.
Daniel follows and shuts the door behind him.
24   INT. MEL'S KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER
Mel, with his old, frail hunch, walks into the kitchen with Daniel following.
MEL
Sit. Sit.
Daniel tries the light switch four times. It doesn't work.
MEL (CONT'D)
What? You think I'm keeping all the electricity for myself?
Daniel laughs.
DANIEL
It's my OCD--
MEL
I know, I know. My crank radio said it could be weeks. A substation blew and two major towers fell. Not the wood ones. The big, tall metal ones...Sit. Applesauce.
DANIEL
I can't stay long.
MEL
How long does it take to eat applesauce? I'll get you an applesauce. If you don't eat it, I will.
Mel starts to walk out of the room.
DANIEL
Why isn't your applesauce in the kitchen?
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 19.
MEL
You have your ways. I have mine.
DANIEL
I organized your fridge.
MEL
Does this make you uncomfortable?
DANIEL
Yes.
Mel laughs and walks out.
MEL
Good. Can't control everything.
Daniel looks over at the shelf where he put the LIGHT BULBS, BATTERIES and BOX OF YAHRZEIT CANDLES.
DANIEL
Mel?
Mel doesn't answer.
Daniel looks around, thinking briefly, but acting quickly... He quietly stands up and hurries over to the shelf.
He fills his pockets with D-CELL BATTERIES, CANDLES, MATCHES and hurries out of the room with THE BOX OF YAHRZEIT CANDLES.
25   INT. MEL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daniel moves quickly through the hall toward the door.
MEL (O.C.)
Daniel?
Mel catches Daniel stealing the items.
DANIEL
...
Mel is holding the TWO APPLESAUCES.
MEL
Oh.
He approaches, disappointed.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 20.
MEL (CONT'D)
You can have the batteries and matches and regular candles. But you can't have those. The Yahrzeit Candles.
DANIEL
I need them.
MEL
Oh. Little Danny. What's happening to you...Yizkor is coming up. I need to light them for my Elaine, Ruby, Cal, My parents...
DANIEL
...
MEL
These are Yahrzeit candles. We light them for the dead. Do not take them. What would my Elaine say? Or has she been gone so long you don't remember her baking you meals with cookies every week?
DANIEL
I'm really sorry. I'll pay you back.
Mel nods, hurt.
MEL
Please, don't come back over.
DANIEL
Mel?
Mel puts an APPLESAUCE on top of the BOX OF YAHRZEIT CANDLES Daniel carries along with the other stolen items.
Daniel is selfish, but he genuinely feels deep remorse.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I'm really sorry...It's just I'm afraid of the dark.
MEL
It's okay. I know you.
Mel taps Daniel's shoulder as he walks to the couch.
Mel sits down and opens his APPLESAUCE. He takes a bite. Mel's depressed his young friend turned out so rotten.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 21.
Daniel leaves.
26   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - EVENING
Struggling to carry his loot, Daniel plops everything on the counter, then lining all of the items up neatly.
The BOX says YAHRZEIT on the side and says Burns for 24 hours guaranteed.
He opens the BOX filled with ten short and stout candles that have Hebrew and English wrapped around them.
He holds one up and looks at the words: The human soul is a light from G-d. May it be your will that the soul--
Daniel uses a MATCH to light the YAHRZEIT CANDLE. Then he lights another YAHRZEIT CANDLE.
He places a YAHRZEIT CANDLE on the table and carries the other into the hallway.
27   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel, holding a YAHRZEIT CANDLE, stands in front of a door with several DEADBOLTS.
With caution, he unlocks the DEADBOLTS and opens the door.
The room is dark, filled with stacks of STORAGE BOXES covered in dust and webs. There is a playmat on the floor that looks like roads for a child to play cars on. It is a child's old bedroom converted to hold storage many years ago.
Daniel walks in with the YAHRZEIT CANDLE.
Daniel opens a SMALL TRUNK. He uses the candle to look for something. He finds a 500-piece PUZZLE of a Flowery Field.
Behind him, in the doorway, he hears a BANG (JARRING)
He turns around fearfully. There is nothing there.
He finishes quickly and hurries out with the PUZZLE and CANDLE, we see through the door frame, across the hall is a large FRAMED PHOTO containing a STOCK HAPPY FAMILY.
The door is slammed. We hear the deadbolts lock.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 22.
28   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel sits at the table, flanked by two YAHRZEIT CANDLES. On the table is the unopened PUZZLE.
He takes the lid off and looks inside at the disorganization.
He takes one PIECE out and places it down flat. It's not an end piece, but he moves it to the edge of the table.
He takes another PIECE out and slides it next to the other puzzle piece.
He quarter-turns it four times, rhythmically. He's already stressed.
He hears something in the dark hallway...like a scratch. He tries to ignore it.
He puts the two puzzle pieces back into the box and closes the lid.
He hears the same scratching sound in the hallway. He's nervous now, looking into the dark hallway.
He stands up, holding a YAHRZEIT CANDLE. He slowly walks into the dark hallway.
29   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
With the YAHRZEIT CANDLE, he walks into the dark hallway to inspect.
At first he sees nothing wrong, but then he notices the FRAMED PHOTO with a HAPPY FAMILY STOCK PHOTO hanging along the hallway, the one across from the DEADBOLT DOOR, is askew.
He checks the DEADBOLT DOOR. It's locked.
He turns to the FRAMED PHOTO, holding the YAHRZEIT CANDLE up to it.
It's a STOCK PHOTO of a happy family, the one that came with the frame. It says 8x10 on it and even has a barcode.
Daniel straightens the frame.
As he looks up and down the hallway, we can faintly see they are all STOCK PHOTOS hanging.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 23.
30   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel walks into the dark bedroom, holding both YAHRZEIT CANDLES.
He stops when he walks in, looking around.
He checks back behind him too, looking down the dark hallway.
Daniel slowly steps in and shuts the door behind him. He locks it.
He walks the perimeter of the room.
He opens the closet. Normal. He closes it.
He opens the bathroom door. Normal. He closes it. He approaches the bed and looks underneath. Normal.
He sets his YAHRZEIT CANDLES down on the bedside tables at opposite ends of the bed, aligning them with the corners.
He begins to fluff the sheet, then tuck it tightly just so as he always does.
He plugs his drained PHONE into the wall hoping the power will turn on in the middle of the night.
He gets into bed and tucks himself in very cozy, but he's nervous without his regular lights and TV.
He stares straight out into the dark. Looking around the room. His senses are heightened.
After a moment, he hears something in the bathroom. A small click.
He stares straight in the direction.
He hears a few more clicks...almost like a plastic rubbing.
He swallows hard, pulls the blanket off himself and steps onto the floor.
He grabs one of the YAHRZEIT CANDLES, the one from the nearest bedside table, and slowly walks toward the bathroom.
The door is closed, as he left it.
He knocks on the door, very quietly, four times. He waits, listening.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 24.
31   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daniel opens the bathroom door. His face is illuminated by just the YAHRZEIT CANDLE.
He doesn't notice anything strange in the bathroom immediately.
He sees his reflection in the mirror. He's hunched and terrified. He realizes how silly this is, but he cannot help it.
He hears the plastic click sound again. Louder and closer.
He looks forward to the SHOWER CURTAIN, sure that there is something...someone beyond it.
He steps forward, stretching the candle out in front of him.
He reaches forward with his free hand, about to touch the SHOWER CURTAIN, taps it four times.
DANIEL
(to self, very quiet) S--T--O--P.
He quickly pulls open the SHOWER CURTAIN like ripping off a band-aid.
All seems fine in the shower and tub.
Daniel steps into the shower and, upon investigating, notices some of the SOAP NOZZLES are not pointing straight.
He huffs, He hates this.
He sets the YAHRZEIT CANDLE down.
Daniel realigns each SOAP NOZZLE to point forward just so.
Daniel finishes and picks the YAHRZEIT CANDLE back up. He closes the SHOWER CURTAIN in four bursts and begins to exit the bathroom.
As he steps out, he hears something fall in the shower. He is a combination of angry, irritated and afraid.
He quickly ticks with his hand four times then pulls the SHOWER CURTAIN open.
He sees a BOTTLE OF SOAP has fallen. The top has broken and soap is spilling all over.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 25.
Daniel throws it in the trash.
He turns the shower on with a quick four turns of the nozzle, then pushes the soap down the drain with his foot.
32   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Daniel is back in bed, tucked in just so, with YAHRZEIT CANDLES at each end of the bed.
He still can't sleep. His eyes peeled wide open, staring into the dark.
He hears the SHOWER CURTAIN and rings slide open and close. He is petrified now.
He hears the SHOWER CURTAIN and rings slide again.
He quickly gets out of bed and, with a YAHRZEIT CANDLE, stomps over to the bathroom and pauses defiantly.
DANIEL
(louder and louder)
S--T--O--P. S--T--O--P. S--T--O--P.
He waits again for a moment. Nervously staring at the door.
He hears something and then pulls a LARGE CHAIR over from the desk and barricades the bathroom door with it.
He gets back into bed and places the YAHRZEIT CANDLE down without much thought.
The blanket is all messed up. He fixes it quickly, with little care as he stares into the dark.
33   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
Daniel enters the kitchen slow and exhausted. He sees the fridge door was left open.
All his food is bad and there is water all over the floor.
Daniel immediately grabs a towel and trash bag and tries to clean the water and spoiled food.
Moments later, after cleaning, Daniel is at the sink. He looks exhausted.
He grabs a box of instant oatmeal packets. There is only one PACKET left. He tears it open and pours it into a MUG.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 26.
He turns the sink on and off four times before leaving it running to put some water into his MUG for the oatmeal.
He mixes it thoroughly, four times in one direction, four times in the other...
He eats the cold, partially dry oatmeal. It's not great. He coughs and spits some out into the sink.
Among the chewed, wet oatmeal is a speck of black.
34   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Daniel gets himself situated in the living room.
He's exhausted, but he opens all the curtains and basks in the sunlight that spills in.
He collapses onto the couch.
He tucks the blanket into the cushion folds, wedging himself in just so.
He's comfortable in the well lit room. There is not a thing in the world to scare him.
He closes his eyes.
35   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
Daniel is still asleep on the couch as the sun is setting. There is still no power.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK (JARRING)
Daniel's eyes open wide, in fear.
Around the corner, he can hear the front door unlock and open.
OLDER WOMAN (O.C.)
Daniel. We're home.
OLDER MAN (O.C.)
Daniel. Give us a hand?
Daniel snaps up, off the couch and hurries to the front door and finds it closed, as if nothing happened.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 27.
36   EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - EVENING
As sun sets, Daniel is on his lawn exercising.
He's does four jumping jacks, and then sprints, and then four more jumping jacks, then sprints.
He does this all across the yard until he's exhausted.
The Scruffy Man is walking his dog and notices Daniel's strange behavior.
SCRUFFY MAN
What are you doing?
DANIEL
You're not gonna hit me?
SCRUFFY MAN
No.
The Scruffy Man's dog begins growling at Daniel's house.
DANIEL
I'm exercising. It's exercise--Is he friendly?
SCRUFFY MAN
Usually.
The Scruffy Man is tugging at the LEASH but the tog persists.
DANIEL
Good. I know--I can't sleep well without...well, without power, so I figure exercise will make me tired.
The dog barks at the house, being tugged by the LEASH.
SCRUFFY MAN
(to dog)
Hey. Shh. Shh. Quiet.
The Scruffy Man quiets his dog with some firm pats and has some empathy for Daniel.
SCRUFFY MAN (CONT'D)
That's not a bad idea. My kid isn't sleeping without his nightlight on.
DANIEL
Me too.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 28.
Yeah.
...
SCRUFFY MAN DANIEL
SCRUFFY MAN
I'm gonna try exercising with my kid. You should do it earlier in the day. Otherwise, you'll be awake for a bunch of hours.
The dog barks again.
The scruffy man pulls his dog away.
DANIEL
Thanks.
Daniel feels good, having talked to someone. Daniel starts doing more jumping jacks and sprints.
37   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT
Daniel is holding a YAHRZEIT CANDLE and a FLASHLIGHT. The hallway leading to Daniel's room is very dark.
Daniel shines the FLASHLIGHT down the hall and he doesn't want to go down there.
The FLASHLIGHT strikes a door.
Daniel waits a moment but finds no courage. He walks away.
38   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel is washing his face and upper body using water from the sink.
He brushes his teeth with his finger and spits into the sink. He shuts the water off.
He puts his shirt back on.
There is a hissing in the drain. Like a voice.
He turns the water on and off four times, leaving it off. He doesn't hear anything.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 29.
39   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Daniel is asleep on the couch.
He's tucked into his blanket and has an assortment of REGULAR CANDLES and two YAHRZEIT CANDLES around him and around the room.
A dull glow of moonlight illuminates the translucent white curtain. There is darkness on both sides of the curtain.
SFX: a delicate chime sounds.
Daniel sits up, awake. He looks around, wondering the sound's origin.
Daniel gets up and walks, with his FLASHLIGHT to a CHINA CLOSET.
Daniel sees a SMALL WOODEN MUSIC BOX sitting on the shelf.
He picks it up and shakes it. Listening to see if it will chime.
He winds it four times. It is the same tone he heard, so Daniel feels better, listening to the gentle melody of the SMALL WOODEN MUSIC BOX.
Behind Daniel, at the curtain, from the darkness on the left emerges the silhouetted shape of a gaunt human in rags. It pauses, silhouetted by the moonlit curtain.
The gentle melody stops.
Daniel hears the footsteps as it continues, passing into the darkness on the right, disappearing.
Daniel quickly grabs his FLASHLIGHT and shines it in the area around the window and there is nothing.
DANIEL
You can't be here...
Daniel shines the FLASHLIGHT around the room. There is nothing.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
You can't be here!
Daniel has trouble catching his breath. He coughs hard. He nearly heaves.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 30.
40   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
Daniel reloads his TWO FLASHLIGHTS with fresh BATTERIES like a soldier in a trench during a moment of calm between raids.
He discards the USED BATTERIES and tests each FLASHLIGHT.
He leaves out two YAHRZEIT CANDLES, the BOOK OF MATCHES and the PAIR OF FLASHLIGHTS aligning them with his finger on the edge of the counter with confidence.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
Daniel freezes like a deer in headlights, looking toward the living room.
Daniel steps toward the living room.
41   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel slowly steps towards the front door. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
He pauses.
WOMAN OUTSIDE (O.C.)
Daniel?
He can see the shape of a woman outside, trying to peer through the glass of the door.
Daniel unlocks the bolt...locks it...he does this his usual four times and then opens the door.
WOMAN OUTSIDE (CONT'D)
Hey.
Hey, Jill.
DANIEL
Jill (35, Daniel's overbearing older sister) holds up a BROWN BAG of food.
JILL
Wanna eat?
42   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel and Jill sit across from each other at the table. The curtains are open and sunlight glows in the room.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 31.
On the table is the BROWN BAG along with the closed PUZZLE BOX.
JILL
I'm gonna get some water.
Jill turns on the faucet and fills a CUP up. She turns off the water.
JILL (CONT'D)
I'll get you one too.
She turns on the water and begins filling a SECOND CUP--
DANIEL
Could you--
JILL
Right.
She turns off the water.
She notices the perfectly lined up CANDLES and FLASHLIGHTS.
DANIEL
In a new cup though--
JILL
Got it. I know.
Jill gets a THIRD CUP for Daniel. Frustrated, she turns the water on and off four times the way Daniel likes and fills it up.
She brings the CUPS of water over.
JILL (CONT'D)
You holding up okay? Without power?
DANIEL
I'm okay. How are you? (to himself)
S--T--O--P.
She notices his tick and doesn't say anything.
JILL
We're fine. We've got lots to do. The kids are reading and playing. Sean and I are doing a puzzle too.
Daniel makes sure the PUZZLE BOX is perfectly aligned.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 32.
She empties the bag of food. There are two sandwiches. She takes a bite.
Daniel opens the sandwich. It has grainy mustard.
DANIEL
I don't eat mustard with the little chunks in it.
JILL
It's all we have right now. Everything else went bad. So it's this or nothing.
DANIEL
I'm okay.
Okay.
JILL
She takes another bite.
Daniel looks behind him and stares into the hallway. Jill notices her brother is anxious.
JILL (CONT'D)
So are you doing a puzzle too?
DANIEL
I don't like it. There's too much stuff in it.
JILL
It's perfect for you. It's all about organizing. You can organize the pieces by color. By end piece. And then you just keep going to make sense of it.
DANIEL
It doesn't work like that. There are rules.
JILL
You made up the rules. So can we make up new ones?
Jill moves the BROWN BAG to the side of the table. Daniel makes sure it's aligned with the edge.
She opens the PUZZLE BOX and dumps it out on the table.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 33.
Daniel is panic-stricken.
DANIEL
What are you doing?! Why did you do that?!
JILL
Daniel. Daniel. It's okay.
Daniel begins coughing as he tries to put PUZZLE PIECES back.
DANIEL
I can't breathe.
JILL
You can breathe. You can breathe.
She grabs his hand and breathes with him, in big gulps of air to help him calm down.
JILL (CONT'D)
1.
She breathes in deep and out. Daniel is catching on.
JILL (CONT'D)
2.
DANIEL
2.
Daniel is on pace with her, calming down.
JILL (CONT'D)
3.
JILL (CONT'D)
4.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
3.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
4.
Okay?
Daniel calms down.
JILL (CONT'D)
DANIEL
I feel really heavy.
JILL
You're okay...Ready to try again?
Jill starts looking at the PILE OF PIECES. She finds a few END PIECES and places them along the side of the table.
DANIEL
(anxiety building) They don't match.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 34.
JILL
Just wait.
Daniel lines the unmatching END PIECES along the edge of the table, running his finger along the table.
Jill keeps gathering more END PIECES.
Daniel gets one END PIECE...and then another. They fit together. It takes a second to register, but it feels wonderful for Daniel.
JILL (CONT'D)
See.
They fit.
DANIEL
He smiles, continuing to play along with the puzzle.
JILL
Do you want to come stay with us?
DANIEL
(not looking at Jill) You know I have to stay here.
JILL
Everytime...I thought this was different though. You have no power. And you're alone.
Daniel tries to focus on making order out of the chaotic puzzle strewn about the table.
JILL (CONT'D)
I saw you took the cover off my old car.
DANIEL
I drove. I did. I took the car and went to the store. I did. Really fast though. I need to be here.
JILL
Did you? Actually? Because I thought Daniel doesn't drive.
DANIEL
I don't drive it because it has a scratch on it and it won't go straight.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 35.
JILL
Right. Well, this is great. I gave it to you two years ago and this is a good first. Good, Daniel.
DANIEL
Yes. I went into the gas station. To look for lights and batteries.
JILL
That's how you got them?
DANIEL
...Yes.
JILL
So you're all set.
DANIEL
Yes.
JILL
...When was the last time you came to visit me?
DANIEL
Two years ago.
JILL
And I come?...every week.
Daniel starts counting out S--T--O--P to himself repeatedly.
JILL (CONT'D)
Have Mom and Dad come lately?
DANIEL
No.
Why not?
JILL DANIEL
I don't want to say. I don't like to say.
JILL
Have they come?
DANIEL
(quietly, to self)
S--T--O--P. S--T--O--P. S--T--O--P.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 36.
JILL
Daniel? Can you look at me?
Daniel pauses talking to himself. He finally looks up at Jill.
JILL (CONT'D)
What year did Mom and Dad die? You can say it. Do you still think they're coming? It's okay to say.
DANIEL
I DON'T WANT TO SAY!
Jill pauses in her tracks.
JILL
Okay.
Jill leaves it alone. She smiles at Daniel to let him know everything is okay.
They continue to do the puzzle in silence.
43   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Daniel is in bed, not quite tucked in yet.
He has four YAHRZEIT CANDLES around the room, lighting up corners. There is no dark spot that he can see except maybe the center of the room since the YAHRZEIT CANDLES in the corners are so far.
The CHAIR is still barricading the bathroom door.
Daniel shines his FLASHLIGHT around the center of the room. The corners. The ceiling. All clear.
He grabs one of the two FRAMED PHOTOS on his bedside table. It says 4x6 and has a happy family with a young son and slightly older daughter.
He opens the FRAME.
Underneath the STOCK PHOTO is a REAL PHOTO.
He shines his FLASHLIGHT on the REAL PHOTO. It's older. It's him and Jill as kids with Mom and Dad. It's nice.
In the center of the room is darkness and this worries Daniel.
He shines his FLASHLIGHT and there is nothing there.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 37.
He sets the FLASHLIGHT so it will point at the center of the room. Now nothing can get him.
He puts the REAL PHOTO under the STOCK PHOTO and puts the reassembled FRAME back on the nightstand.
He starts tucking himself tightly into his blankets just so.
As he does, the blanket begins to slowly be pulled down towards the foot of the bed.
It's a moment of slow movement before he notices.
He tugs back on the blanket and it's as if it's caught on something. It stops moving. He can't pull it up.
Aggravated, Daniel steps off the bed, and from the darkness under the bed, a hand reaches out and pulls him. (jarring)
Daniel falls and kicks to break free, and after a moment of terror, he is released.
He screams, crawling back. He jumps back onto the bed where he is well lit.
He tosses the rest of the blanket off the bed and shines his FLASHLIGHT around nervously, freaking out and coughing.
DANIEL
Help! Help me! Please! Help!
No one will hear Daniel's screams. And even if they did, no one is coming to help him.
MATCH CUT TO:
44  EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON
Daniel's yelling carries into the streets.
There are two Public Works people checking the UTILITY BOXES outside.
Daniel is standing on his property yelling across the street.
DANIEL
I just want to know when the power will be back! Tell me!
They try ignoring him as they review their meters connected to UTILITY BOXES.
Daniel hacks and coughs and groans.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 38.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
You don't understand. I can't stay in the dark! You need to get it back going.
Daniel is nervous to step into the street, but he's already done it. So, he takes the big step...he begins crossing the road.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
PLEASE! You need to help me!
A Few neighbors are staring.
The two Public Works employees notice Daniel but try to ignore him.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Hey!
Daniel gets a little too close to one of the workers.
PUBLIC WORKER 1
You need to back off, man.
DANIEL
I'm not touching you!
PUBLIC WORKER 1
I get you're upset. Everyone's upset. Whole region is upset right now. That's why we're out working.
DANIEL
I'm just asking for help!
Daniel's cough gets more severe, even choking him up.
PUBLIC WORKER 1
Let us do our jobs and we can.
DANIEL
What am I supposed to do?!
PUBLIC WORKER 1
Nothing.
Daniel looks back at his house. Pointing.
DANIEL
Something is in there! In the dark!
PUBLIC WORKER 1
I don't know what to tell you.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 39.
Daniel begins to cough so hard and so much he vomits. He collapses and can't breathe.
PUBLIC WORKER 1 (CONT'D)
Yo! Yo, call 911.
Public Worker 2 calls 911 while Public Worker 1 kneels beside Daniel, unsure how to help or approach. He seems potentially dangerous and sick.
45  EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD AMBULANCE - EVENING
Daniel is sitting up with a blanket over his shoulder in the tail of an AMBULANCE.
An EMT wearing GLOVES checks Daniel's pupils with a SMALL PEN LIGHT.
EMT
Do you have panic attacks often?
DANIEL
Sometimes.
Okay.
EMT DANIEL
I'm not supposed to leave the house. I get sick if I leave the house. I can't leave the house.
EMT
You're okay here.
The EMT holds Daniel's wrist and counts.
DANIEL
I can't leave the house again. Bad things happen. I won't leave the house again.
EMT
...They were saying you were talking about ghosts in your house?
DANIEL
(breaking - dilemma)
...I can't go back in.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 40.
EMT
Your heart rate is still up, but your blood pressure is okay. There isn't much I can do for you.
DANIEL
Can I go to the hospital? I've stayed a few days when it's bad like this. I can stay a few days, That's the rule. And then I can go back home and it'll be fixed.
EMT
You won't get admitted. They're on generators and sending most people away...This will be a $5000 one-way cab ride, and then you may be walking home.
DANIEL
My chest. It's like it's filled with weights. It's hard to breathe. I need to go to the hospital for a few days!
The EMT touches Daniel's throat and feels.
EMT
You're not having a heart attack. It's a panic attack. Nothing to be ashamed of...Do you have someone you can stay with?
DANIEL
Please take me to the hospital.
Daniel tears up with nervousness.
EMT
It's okay, it's okay.
Public Worker 1 approaches holding a SMALL FLASHLIGHT. He sees Daniel crying.
PUBLIC WORKER 1
Hey. You feeling better?
EMT
He's gonna be alright.
DANIEL
Don't make me go back in the dark. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 41.
Daniel nearly breaks down feeling tremendous guilt and fear paired with the drop of all that adrenaline.
PUBLIC WORKER 1
It's all good, man. Hey. Why don't you have this.
Public Worker 1 hands Daniel a SMALL FLASHLIGHT.
PUBLIC WORKER 1 (CONT'D)
We got tons of 'em in the shop. Help hold you over until the power comes back.
EMT
Yeah. Here.
The EMT gives Daniel his SMALL PEN LIGHT.
Daniel feels a small sense of relief. He cries putting his face in his hands.
The EMT and Public Worker 1 are not sure what else they can do.
46   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Daniel stands at the open front door, using his new FLASHLIGHT and PEN LIGHT.
He closes the front door behind him.
Shining the lights, he heads into the dark house.
47   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel, using his new SMALL FLASHLIGHT and PEN LIGHT, enters the bedroom.
The blanket is still on the floor.
The chair is still barricading the bathroom door. He has a new confidence, and he moves the chair. He enters the bathroom.
48   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT
Everything seems fine in there.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 42.
He looks behind the curtain. It's fine.
The nozzles are still facing forward, he checks one by one.
Daniel turns the sink on and off, four times, as usual, letting the water run so he can wash off his tooth brush.
He puts toothpaste on it and brushes rhythmically. He spits and looks in the mirror.
He hears a strange sound, almost like a hiss. It becomes more like a wheezing, cry.
Daniel looks around quickly, shining the flashlight. He realizes it's coming from the drain.
Daniel looks down. He can't see anything. But the wheezing stops.
Daniel shines the PEN LIGHT down.
He sees something...it looks like an eye...it blinks. It makes a horrible screeching scream.
Daniel stumbles backwards, terrified.
49   EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel runs outside into the dark night with a FLASHLIGHT swinging around him.
He sprints across his yard to Mel's yard.
50   EXT. MEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Daniel pounds on Mel's door. Four Hard Knocks.
DANIEL
Mel! Mel, Please!
Daniel does four more hard knocks.
MEL (O.C.)
Daniel?
Daniel can hear Mel approach the door inside the dark house.
Daniel is shining his light into the glass of the door, but it is veiled by a thin white curtain.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 43.
From inside, the curtain moves and Mel's face is blasted by the bright FLASHLIGHT.
Mel opens the door.
MEL (CONT'D)
What do you want? Are you okay? What's going on?
Daniel is panicked. Speaking fast and breathing hard.
DANIEL
You have to lift the curse. I can't. I'm sorry. I'll give it all back.
MEL
Curse? What curse? Daniel. Slow down.
DANIEL
The candles. I stole your Jewish candles. And now there are ghosts in my house.
MEL
Slow-slow-slow-slow...There is no curse.
DANIEL
There has to be.
MEL
But there isn't.
DANIEL
...
MEL
...let's take a breath and tell me what's going on.
DANIEL YOU CURSED ME!
MEL
No! You are doing something to yourself.
DANIEL
I'm not this time!
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 44.
MEL
The candles are made in New Jersey! At a factory!
DANIEL
Don't lie to me! What's in my house!?
MEL
Whatever is in your house is something you let in. Not me. Not some candles! You.
Daniel looks beyond Mel and sees something in the dark.
MEL (CONT'D)
Maybe I was too harsh on you. I know you're afraid. I should have been less harsh. Do you want to come in?
DANIEL
No...It's in your house too....You're doing this to me.
MEL
Okay. I don't know what you want me to tell you.
DANIEL
Tell me how to get rid of whatever is haunting me!
MEL
You're doing bad things, Daniel. Bad begets bad. The Talmud says if the eye could see them, no one could endure. 1000 on your right. 10,000 on your left. Your spirit is a bright light, and they come like moths to flame.
DANIEL
Well I can see them. And I'm not doing so well! It was your candle--
MEL
Do a mitzvah! Be a mensch! But-- leave--me--alone.
DANIEL
It's in there too, you know.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 45.
MEL
Goodnight.
Mel shuts the door.
Daniel stands for a moment, panicked.
DANIEL Mel?...MEL?!
He shines his flashlight around.
DANIEL (CONT'D) ARE YOU OKAY?!
Mel pops up in the glass of the front door (jarring).
MEL
(muffled, behind door) Yes. Goodnight.
Mel closes the curtain on the front door. Daniel steps back, away from the door.
51   EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel doesn't want to go back inside.
He shines his FLASHLIGHT on the garage door He opens the garage door.
52   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Daniel sees his CAR under the PROTECTIVE COVER, and he pulls the PROTECTIVE COVER off, tossing it aside haphazardly.
He gets in the CAR, and the break lights illuminate as the engine starts.
The headlamps beam against the wall, lighting up the whole interior of the garage,
53   INT. DANIEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Daniel, in his CAR, turns the console light on. He's got a little more than a quarter tank.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 46.
He checks all his mirrors to make sure no one is around him...haunting him. He's clear.
He turns the air on and feels it blow against his face. It's nice.
He turns the radio on. He smiles. He changes the radio station four times and leaves it.
He leans his seat back and closes his eyes.
54   INT. DANIEL'S CAR - MORNING
Daniel wakes up feeling refreshed.
He notices the radio isn't working. He tries turning it on and off.
The air isn't on either. There is nothing coming from the vents.
Daniel tries to turn the key. Nothing happens except a click. He does it three more times, just a click.
The car is dead. Daniel sighs.
55   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Daniel is well lit with his FLASHLIGHTS and YAHRZEIT CANDLES around the room.
He goes to the shelf which once was full of batteries and candles, now it's filled with empty BATTERY PACKS and an EMPTY YAHRZEIT CANDLE BOX.
He's on his last candles and no batteries are left. He's nervous.
He tries to replace the BATTERIES on one FLASHLIGHT. He turns it on and off four times. It doesn't work. He puts another set of BATTERIES into the FLASHLIGHT.
He turns it on and off four times. It still doesn't work. He tosses the FLASHLIGHT aside.
He immediately picks it up and places it on the counter, aligning the edge of the FLASHLIGHT with the table.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 47.
He breathes in and out to stay calm.
Daniel sits down at the table. He looks over the PUZZLE, but it's difficult to see it by candlelight.
He's made some progress. The entire outline of the END PIECES is done.
He tries to put pieces in piles of color. He's diligent and the focus relaxes him.
In the darkness, straight ahead of him, he hears something...labored wheezing, like it is in pain.
Daniel looks forward nervously. Waiting. The sound gets nearer.
An outline of a figure approaches.
Daniel recognizes the sound...the shape. It's what has been following him.
Daniel stays calm as he fights to suppress his nervous coughing.
As the dark outline gets very close...close enough where we can see its facial features glow in the dim candlelight...
A skeletal face with sunken black pits for eyes, with hair and skin wrapping like course, rotten burlap...(the Burlap Ghost)
Daniel is in such fear, he is unable to breathe in the presence of the Burlap Ghost.
And then...
The POWER turns back on. In an instant the Burlap Ghost
disappears as all of the lights in Daniel's house turn on.
Daniel, who was unable to breathe, gasps air in relief for a moment.
He rushes to the window. The other houses are on too.
He laughs like a madman who has found salvation.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 48.
56   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Daniel is as happy as can be as he runs into the bedroom with all the lights already on.
He hops toward the nightstand and finds his phone charging. It's askew, so he quickly straightens it.
The TV is on. The lights are on. The darkness is gone.
He breathes in a very deep sigh of relief, and as he exhales coughs a bit.
57   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
The lights are on in the kitchen. It's bright and nice, albeit a bit messy from the hectic past few days.
The PUZZLE on the table has some progress. The edges are done, and some of the corners are worked on. There are piles in the center organized by color.
Daniel swipes the entire PUZZLE into a trash bag.
Daniel sits in front of the fridge and throws everything away into TRASH BAGS.
There is a brief brown out, the lights all dip and return to normal.
Daniel looks beside him, his phone is plugged into the wall, charging beside him on the floor. It's still charging.
58   EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel walks down his driveway carrying the TRASH BAGS.
He leans out from his property and leaves them on the curb. The whole neighborhood has power.
He has a skip in his step as he turns back to the house.
All of the lights are on, beaming through the curtains unti-- The power cuts out.
Daniel Freezes.
After a moment the front door opens.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 49.
It's black inside, but Daniel can see the Burlap Ghost
waiting for him.
Just then, the power in the neighborhood kicks back on.
The Burlap Ghost is gone. The door, slowly swinging, wide open.
59   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel opens the closet. Nothing there. Daniel opens the bathroom door. Nothing there.
Daniel steps toward the bed, but he's slow to put his foot beside the bed, but he does.
Daniel checks under the bed. There is nothing there.
Daniel looks around the room, feeling smug, like he has won. Then he makes the bed just so.
There is a YAHRZEIT CANDLE burning by his bedside. He blows it out.
The lights all work. The TV is on. The phone is charging.
Daniel has won.
He climbs into bed and tucks himself in just so.
After a moment, his phone pings.
He grabs it, the alert is from his home security app:
Movement in the kitchen.
Daniel types in his passcode 7--8--6--7 (S--T--O--P) He watches the camera feed.
60   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
The kitchen looks normal. Nothing is moving.
He watches for a moment but doesn't see anything.
61   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daniel takes the TV remote and changes the channel four times as usual. He smiles watching the TV, comfy in bed.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 50.
He gets another alert: movement in the living room.
Daniel gets his PHONE and types in his passcode 7--8--6--7 (S--T--O--P)
62   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
He sees nothing.
As he watches another alert pops up: movement in the hallway.
63   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT
He looks and sees nothing. It is the door to the bedroom.
64   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daniel looks at the door. He tosses the PHONE aside, unlike him, and then springs up and locks the door.
He stands at the door for a moment. He checks to make sure it's locked.
He gets back in bed, tucking himself in just so. The PHONE beeps again...and again...and again...
He grabs the PHONE, silences it and puts the PHONE down carefully, aligning it with the edges of the bedside table.
With all the lights on, Daniel watches TV until he's comfortable enough to close his eyes.
65   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
The kitchen looks normal. Nothing is moving.
66   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The living room looks normal. Nothing is moving.
67   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT
The hallway looks normal. Nothing is moving...
Zooming into the grainy footage...the door handle is turning, slowly, back and forth.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 51.
Then it stops moving.
68   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Daniel is asleep in bed, tucked in tightly.
The TV is frozen and with a message: Are you still watching? Powering off in 0:10, 0:09, 0:08...
The TV Turns off. Despite some lights. There is now a shadowy corner.
The Burlap Ghost stands in the dark corner near Daniel's bed.
Daniel begins to shake, as if he can't wake up from a dream. He hums and moans and tries to break free.
He wakes up with a start, panicked and looking around the mostly well lit room. He realizes the TV is off.
He starts coughing and hacking. There is black mucus in his hand.
He wipes it off with a tissue from the nightstand. He turns the TV back on, his eyes scanning the room.
He grabs a FLASHLIGHT from the nightstand and shines it around the room.
He sees nothing out of the norm, but the FLASHLIGHT dies.
He puts it back on the nightstand, but it rolls off. He leaves it on the floor.
...there is something under the bed, in the dark. It grabs the FLASHLIGHT.
Daniel hears the clicking of the FLASHLIGHT, on and off, on and off.
He looks over the side of the bed and doesn't see the FLASHLIGHT...
Then, it rolls back out.
Daniel turns on his PHONE FLASHLIGHT. It is still charging, and he dangles it off the table so the PHONE FLASHLIGHT points under the bed.
He leans off the bed and looks under the bed. There is nothing there.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 52.
He leaves the PHONE FLASHLIGHT pointing under the bed, dangling as it charges.
Daniel stays quiet, huddled on the bed, trying to find comfort, but he won't.
69   EXT. MEL'S HOUSE - MORNING KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
Daniel pounds on Mel's door. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
There is no answer.
Daniel is eyeing Mel's OLD SEDAN.
Daniel is impatient. He reaches under a SPECIFIC ROCK in the garden and gets Mel's SPARE KEY.
He opens the door.
DANIEL
Mel?...Mel?
Daniel steps in.
70   INT. MEL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Mel is lying on the couch. He looks sick, his forearm draped over his eyes.
MEL
What are you doing here, Daniel?
DANIEL
I was hoping I could borrow your car.
Mel looks at Daniel for a moment and then covers his eyes again with his forearm.
MEL
You don't have a driver's license.
DANIEL
I drove my sister's old car the other day.
MEL
So drive that.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 53.
DANIEL
It's dead. I just--
MEL
I've been taking care of you since you were a boy! What is going on with you! What is this NEW THING?!
DANIEL
I just need to go to the store...
MEL
I don't feel well...
DANIEL
I don't feel well either.
Mel turns away.
Daniel steps into the kitchen as Mel lies on the couch.
He holds Mel's KEY CHAIN and stands for a moment, waiting for Mel to say something.
Daniel walks out of the house, closing the door behind him. Mel hears his old car start.
71  INT. DEPARTMENT STORE
Daniel, wearing PLASTIC BAGS OVER HIS SHOES, wheels a CART up to the Checkout Cashier (25, indifferent).
CHECKOUT CASHIER
Find everything you need?
DANIEL
Yeah. Thanks.
Daniel puts one BOX CONTAINING A LAMP up at a time, lining it up with the edge of the table. He puts another up.
CHECKOUT CASHIER
If they're all the same, I can scan the same one. How many you have?
He puts another one up. Aligning it.
DANIEL
I kinda need you to scan each of them.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 54.
CHECKOUT CASHIER
(annoyed) That's fine.
As she scans them, he puts it into the cart.
He's constantly looking over his shoulder and around the store.
The Checkout Cashier notices his strange behavior.
Lastly are BOXES OF BATTERIES, A BOX OF CANDLES and BOX OF YAHRZEIT CANDLES.
She finishes scanning everything.
CHECKOUT CASHIER (CONT'D)
That'll be $524.76.
Daniel looks over everything.
DANIEL
My credit limit is only $500.
CHECKOUT CASHIER
You can take off one of the lamps?
Daniel nods.
DANIEL
(to himself)
1--2--3--4. 1--2--3--4. S--T--O--P.
He takes a lamp out and places it on the counter.
She looks at him strangely. He doesn't like her judgment.
CHECKOUT CASHIER
$489.58.
He swipes his credit card.
72   INT. MEL'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
SFX: Mel's OLD SEDAN pulls up and shuts off. The door opens and closes. The Trunk opens and closes.
The front door opens.
Daniel steps in holding a BOX OF YAHRZEIT CANDLES and a BOX OF BATTERIES.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 55.
DANIEL
Mel. I wanted to make it up to you. And do the right thing...
Daniel sees Mel is sleeping on the couch. He doesn't bother him.
He puts the BOX OF YAHRZEIT CANDLES a BOX OF BATTERIES down
onto the table, carefully aligning them with the edge.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
So that's even now?
Daniel waits, looking around into the dark hallway.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Alright. See ya, Mel.
Daniel leaves.
73   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Daniel is sitting on the floor surrounded by OPENED LAMP BOXES and assembled LAMPS. It's messy. His phone is charging beside him.
The LAMPS are all plugged in around him, beaming light. He is assembling the last LAMP.
He finishes it by screwing in a LIGHT BULB.
He carries the LAMP near the front door, leaving it on the floor. He plugs it in and it works. He leaves it there.
74   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel plugs in two LAMPS in the kitchen. It's much brighter in there.
75   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Through the hallway leading to Daniel's bedroom, Daniel has already left a series of LAMPS on the floor, to stay lit.
76   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Daniel has set LAMPS in all four corners of the room.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 56.
He has one LAMP tilted to light up under the bed. It is very bright. There are no dark spots.
He also has CANDLES lit throughout the room in case of a sudden blackout.
He's set.
Daniel is unafraid, folding his blanket's just so.
He tucks himself into bed, turning on the TV. He changes the channel four times.
He is comfortable despite being in a room brighter than daylight.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK (downstairs at the front door) Daniel closes his eyes to ignore it.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK (downstairs at the front door)
DANIEL
(to self, silently)
S--T--O--P--S--T--O--P--S--T--O--P
He can hear the front door open.
OLDER WOMAN (O.C.)
Daniel. We're home.
OLDER MAN (O.C.)
Daniel. Give us a hand?
DANIEL
STOP! STOP! STOP! STOP!
Everything calms for a moment.
He gets an alert on his phone. (jarring)
He grabs his PHONE, attached to the wall by the CHARGER. There is an alert: there is movement in the living room.
He taps it to open the footage.
77   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The front door isn't opened. He sees nothing.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 57.
DANIEL
(grainy intercom voice) Whoever--Whatever's down there. You need to leave. The entire house has lights. You need to leave. Now.
He hears the something in the two-way monitor. A wheezy, in pain voice. He can't make out what it says.
The LAMP by the door shuts off. The light shuts off.
78   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daniel begins coughing nervously as he stares at his PHONE. He wipes away black spittle. He's afraid.
He hears a bang downstairs.
79   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
The LAMPS and regular lights cut out.
80   INT. SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT
The overhead light cuts off.
One by one the LAMPS leading up to the door slowly turn off.
81   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daniel gets up and locks the door. He stands back, afraid, trying to silence his cough.
The lights in the hallway that glow in the cracks of the door go out.
Daniel sees...the door handle turn. Daniel smacks the door four times.
DANIEL
It's locked! Stay out!
The door handle stops turning.
One of the LAMPS in the room turns off. Daniel steps back nervously.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 58.
Then another turns off.
Daniel grabs a CANDLE and retreats into the bathroom.
82   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel rushes into the well-lit bathroom with his candle. He shuts and locks the door and he faces the door.
Through the crack under the door, Daniel sees the lights in the bedroom all click off.
Then...there is a gentle pushing on the door. Daniel begins coughing nervously.
DANIEL
You have to go. You have to leave me alone. LEAVE! LEAVE!
The main lights in the bathroom go out.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
(to self, fast, afraid)
S--T--O--P--S--T--O--P--S--T--O--P
Daniel flips the switch four times but they won't turn on. The LAMP on the counter turns off.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
STOP!
Daniel is left with just the candle. He backs away from the door, all the way to the shower curtain.
He can hear the painful wheezing in the room with him.
The shower curtain slightly moves, as if a face presses against it, just above Daniel's. Outstretched arms take shape pressing against the curtain waiting like a trap about to spring...
The Burlap Ghost behind the shower curtain strikes quickly, wrapping up Daniel and pulling him down into the tub. The CANDLE immediately extinguishes.
We hear a brief struggle as Daniel screams bloody murder in the dark.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 59.
83   EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Daniel's muffled screams can be heard on the empty street. His house is pitch black as everyone else's is well lit.
His screams abruptly stop.
After a moment of silence, his lights turn on. Daniel is crying and heaving.
84   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel stumbles out of the well-lit bathroom into the bedroom, struggling to catch his breath.
The room is well lit again, but a mess. The blankets are all tossed aside. The LAMPS are all turned over.
Daniel tries to open the door, but it is still locked. He unlocks it and nearly falls into the hallway.
85   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
The LAMPS in the hallway are all turned over.
The FRAMED PHOTOS lining the hallway that once showed STOCK PHOTOS are all showing FAMILY PHOTOS...Daniel's family.
Photos of him as a boy. Photos of his parent's wedding. Photos of him and his sister. Photos with Mel and another woman...happy memories. Daniel doesn't want to look at them.
In his coughing stupor, he pulls them off the walls. Carrying them.
Daniel opens the other door, the dead bolted door.
86   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
In the dusty, cobweb covered room, which was a child's bedroom many years ago, are stacks of STORAGE BOXES containing old memories, caked in layers of dust and webs.
He haphazardly throws the FRAMED PHOTOS inside.
Daniel yells angrily, knocking over storage boxes. He stumbles back, leaning against the wall.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 60.
He coughs and coughs, hacking up a mess of black mucus into his hand.
From a dark crevice between STORAGE BOXES, an OLD BLUE TOY CAR rolls out.
Daniel, reaching for the OLD BLUE TOY CAR, collapses struggling to breathe. His eyes are closing.
As they do, among the STORAGE BOXES he sees the Burlap Ghost
watching him.
87   INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM - DARK
Daniel is a young boy, 7 years old. He's laying on his stomach playing with an OLD BLUE TOY CAR.
The bedroom door is closed. The curtains are closed. The room is very dark.
DANIEL
(calmly, to himself)
S. T. O. P. Stop.
The Burlap Ghost stands behind the young boy, he winds up the SMALL WOODEN MUSIC BOX and sets it down as it plays a gentle melody.
Daniel moves the car again.
Where the Burlap Ghost was stands a man. A dangerous looking man.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
S. T. O. P. Stop.
DANGEROUS LOOKING MAN
S. T. O. P. Stop.
DANGEROUS LOOKING MAN (CONT'D)
Good. Keep saying it. Again and again.
Daniel tries to turn around.
DANGEROUS LOOKING MAN (CONT'D)
Don't turn around!
Daniel winces and faces forward, trying to focus on the car.
YOUNG DANIEL
(nervous, faster)
S. T. O. P. Stop. S. T. O. P. Stop.
S. T. O. P. Stop. S. T. O. P. Stop.
Outside the room. The front door opens.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 61.
The Dangerous looking man looms over, with a knife.
DANGEROUS LOOKING MAN
Don't say a thing.
Daniel aligns the toy car perfectly along the edge of the PLAYMAT, with cartoon roads and street signs, using his finger to trace the edges.
MOM (O.C.)
Daniel. We're home.
DAD (O.C.)
Daniel. Give us a hand?
The dangerous man stands poised with the knife. Waiting. Daniel's eyes are shut tight.
Daniel tucks his toes underneath a PLAYMAT.
DAD (O.C.) (CONT'D)
Your sister's team won.
MOM
(right outside the door) Daniel. I can hear you listening to the music box.
Knock. Knock. Knock. Knock.
The door knob turns but won't open.
DAD
Daniel? Open up.
The dangerous looking man psyches himself up. He reaches forward, unlocks the door.
It opens. Daniel's Mom (40) and dad (40) are stunned to see this maniac.
He lunges at them with the KNIFE.
YOUNG DANIEL
(scared, fast, repeatedly)
S. T. O. P. Stop. S. T. O. P. Stop.
S. T. O. P. Stop. S. T. O. P. Stop.
Daniel lies on the ground watching the empty doorway leading into the hall. He hears the commotion of the fight and the screams.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 62.
MOM (O.C.)
Honey!
He sees his dad drop to the floor, his dead eyes staring at Daniel.
MOM (O.C.) (CONT'D)
Please. Please. No. No.
She squeals as she is stabbed.
Daniel's dad's dead eyes still stare at him. The gentle melody quickly slows to a stop.
The Dangerous man's footsteps rush off towards the front door. The door opens and there is silence.
Daniel opens his eyes.
88   INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE STORAGE ROOM - MORNING
Daniel's eyes snap open. He's in the room where it happened.
It's dark in the room with the curtains closed among stacks of dusty STORAGE BOXES and the pile of FRAMED PHOTOS he brought in.
He's laying on his stomach, facing the door, where his dad died.
Daniel is feeling horrible in his chest with a blinding headache. There's a terrible taste in his mouth and there is BLACK MUCUS AND SPITTLE on his face and hands.
He looks around. Nothing is there.
He pulls out his phone, but it is cracked and broken from falling.
He stands up and leaves the room.
A moment later we hear the front door open.
89   EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel stumbles outside. The light is painful to his throbbing head. He coughs again, wiping the BLACK SPITTLE onto his clothes.
He steps onto the lawn, walking to Mel's.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 63.
90   EXT. MEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel knocks four times on Mel's door. There is no answer at Mel's.
It's dark in there. Mel's not responding.
DANIEL
Mel? Mel, please. I need help.
Daniel opens the door.
It is dark in there with all the curtains closed. All the lights off.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Mel?
Daniel is afraid to go in.
He can hear Mel gasping for air.
MEL
(whispering, deathly ill) Daniel? Daniel?
Daniel takes one step in, but he sees down the hall, staring right at him, the Burlap Ghost. It looks right at him.
Daniel steps back.
Daniel looks out to the street. He calls out.
DANIEL
Help! Please! Someone help!
The neighbors don't open their doors for him.
Daniel looks back inside and the Burlap Ghost steps out of sight.
He can hear Mel dying right in front of him. Daniel musters courage and charges in.
91   INT. MEL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel charges into the house and finds Mel laying on the ground.
The Burlap Ghost stands across him.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 64.
DANIEL
I'm taking him.
Daniel steps closer, and the Burlap Ghost does too.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
S. T. O. P. Stop. STOP!
Daniel kneels down to pick up Mel. And as he does, the Burlap Ghost leaves him alone.
Daniel stares at it. It stares back, tilting its head.
Daniel, with all his coughing and BLACK MUCUS, carries Mel toward the front door, leaving the Burlap Ghost inside, watching.
92   EXT. MEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Daniel puts Mel into the backseat of Mels' OLD SEDAN and they drive away.
93   INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM
Daniel is sitting in a waiting room at the Hospital. He sees sick and dying people.
There is a little boy (8) wearing a small BASEBALL GLOVE sitting with his Sick Mom (35). She looks very ill.
Daniel is nervous, counting to four on his hand, over and over.
LITTLE BOY
Why are you doing that?
Daniel smiles at him, trying not to cough.
DANIEL
Counting? It's my rule...I dunno.
The little kid sits back. He looks nervous.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Are you nervous about your mom?
The little boy nods.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Honestly, when I'm scared, I count to four on my hands, four times.
(MORE)
DANIEL (CONT'D)
And I do it until I'm not scared anymore. Wanna try it with me?
The little boy nods again.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF
65.
They slowly count off four on their fingers.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
One. Two. Three Four...One. Two. Three Four...One. Two. Three Four...One. Two. Three Four...
LITTLE BOY
One. Two. Three Four...One. Two. Three Four...One. Two. Three Four...One. Two. Three Four...
Daniel looks at the little boy who has a little smile.
Daniel begins to cough and hack. He wipes BLACK MUCUS away with a tissue.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Great job. Feel any better?
LITTLE BOY
What else?
What else?
Daniel laughs.
DANIEL
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I make up all sorts of rules. For myself. No one else has to do them. Just me.
The little boy watches with wonder.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Okay. Watch this.
Daniel leans forward and aligns the magazine with the edge of the table, and rubs his finger along it.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
I do that, because if I don't I think everything will fall and break.
The little kid rearranges the magazine and aligns it perfectly just like Daniel did.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
What about monsters. Hate them?
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 66.
LITTLE BOY
There's one in my closet.
DANIEL
Well, here's my rule. As long as I keep my toes tucked under my blanket, monsters can't get me.
LITTLE BOY
What about socks.
DANIEL
Anything you want. They're your rules.
LITTLE BOY
I don't like socks.
DANIEL
What do you like?
LITTLE BOY
Baseball.
Daniel looks at the boy still wearing a BASEBALL GLOVE.
DANIEL
What if your rule was nothing could get you, as long as you had a baseball glove nearby.
The little boy smiles, punching into his BASEBALL GLOVE.
Daniel smiles at the boy's mother. She smiles back as the little boy feels less afraid.
Daniel begins to cough pretty horrendously.
A triage nurse (30, kind) approaches Daniel with another tissue.
TRIAGE NURSE
Hey, have you been seen?
DANIEL
No. I'm here waiting for my neighbor. Mel Goldberg.
TRIAGE NURSE
I think he was sent back, but I can't release any information about him--how long have you had that cough?
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 67.
DANIEL
It's nothing. It comes and goes. A few months.
TRIAGE NURSE
Any strange color mucus?
DANIEL
No. It's usually just black.
TRIAGE NURSE
(laughs, but serious) That's a strange color mucus.
DANIEL
It's a normal everyday thing to me.
TRIAGE NURSE
...That's dried blood.
Daniel looks worried. He makes a funny face at the little boy.
TRIAGE NURSE (CONT'D)
Let's take a look at you.
DANIEL
Why don't you see her. She's been here a lot longer than me.
TRIAGE NURSE
She's being taken care of. Why don't you come back with me.
Daniel stands and the little boy tries to hand Daniel his BASEBALL GLOVE.
DANIEL
Thanks little man, but that's yours.
(with a wink) See ya, bud.
The little boy, with a smile, counts to four on his fingers tucked into the BASEBALL GLOVE as Daniel walks away.
94   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Daniel is laying in a hospital bed. He's got an IV. The lights are on. The television is on.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 68.
The lights in the hallway are very bright as indifferent hospital workers pass by the doorway in their scrubs.
Daniel is tucked into the hospital blanket just so. He is trying to relax, but that's unlikely.
The doctor (45, straight shooter and seemingly indifferent) walks in holding a clipboard.
DOCTOR
Hey...Mr. Clay.
DANIEL
Daniel is fine.
DOCTOR
Okay, Daniel.
(he reviews the notes)
Has anyone been by to talk to you?
DANIEL
No.
DOCTOR
Okay...It's not good.
He shuts the TV off then walks to a panel by the wall. He places an X-RAY on the panel and it lights up.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
These are your lungs.
The X-RAY is his lungs, but they are covered in haze.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
You see all these dark shadowy areas...we don't like dark shadowy areas.
DANIEL
You have no idea. We hate dark shadowy areas.
The doctor doesn't laugh at Daniel's new-found charm.
DOCTOR
Okay. So, those dark shadowy areas are--well, Mr. Clay, it's cancer.
Daniel is stunned.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 69.
All of it?
DANIEL
DOCTOR
Yeah. Do you have any family history of cancer?
DANIEL
My sister died of lung cancer. Two years ago.
DOCTOR
Okay. Well that's what it looks like here. Lung Cancer, but it's spread. Pretty badly too.
DANIEL
What does that mean?
DOCTOR
...Do you have anyone you want to call? To come down here?
DANIEL
I came in with my friend. Mel Goldberg. He's my G-dfather.
DOCTOR
Okay. I'll go see if he's around. In the meantime I'm going to set you up with a specialist who can go over some treatment options asap.
Okay?
DANIEL
Thanks.
The doctor walks out. Daniel is left stunned.
He looks at his hands. But he doesn't count. He doesn't cough. He's just stunned.
MEL (O.C.)
Hey kiddo.
Hey, Mel.
DANIEL
Mel is in a hospital gown and in a wheel chair. He's got his own IV too.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 70.
MEL
This is good stuff.
Mel slaps the IV bag.
DANIEL
You okay?
MEL
Yeah. Just dehydrated. Old man stuff. You saved my life though.
DANIEL
I'm sorry.
Daniel is trying not to cry, but he does. Mel is super supportive.
MEL
It's okay. You're okay now. It's okay buddy. We're okay.
Daniel calms down.
DANIEL
They said I'm dying.
MEL
Soon?
Daniel nods. Mel thinks it over.
MEL (CONT'D)
What are you thinking?
DANIEL
I'm scared of the dark. And that's all death is, right? Dark?
MEL
No. No. That's why you were scared of that candle. You don't see it. The soul, it's a big bright light. We don't know where it goes, and that's scary, but it's not dark.
It's bright. That's why we light a candle for the dead, to symbolize the bright soul reaching up to heaven. You brought me here. That's a mitzvah. You're a mensch. You're a good kid with a bright, bright soul.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 71.
DANIEL
Will you light a Yahrzeit Candle for me? When I'm...
Mel smiles warmly at Daniel as they hold hands.
Daniel sees the Burlap Ghost in the dark corner. Mel knows what Daniel sees.
MEL
It can't hurt you anymore.
DANIEL
You see it too?
MEL
Now I do.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
TRIAGE NURSE
Daniel?
The nurse enters.
TRIAGE NURSE (CONT'D)
Hey. I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, I'm...I'm really sorry. Your friend, Mel. He died.
Daniel is alone in the room as the nurse speaks to him from the doorway. Mel is gone. The Burlap Ghost is gone.
TRIAGE NURSE (CONT'D)
Is there anything I can do? Or get you?
She, very kindly, steps in and turns the TV on. Pours him some water. And stands beside him.
Daniel wipes a tear from his eye, breathes deep and smiles.
DANIEL
This is a strange request.
She looks down, willing to help.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Can I have some applesauce?
She laughs.
TRIAGE NURSE
Sure. I'll get you a few.
MOTH - DW MEDOFF 72.
DANIEL
Thanks.
She walks off determined.
Daniel uses the remote to change the station four times.
He looks uncomfortable though with the TV on and tucked under the blanket just so.
He kicks the blanket off his feet, letting his toes touch the air and he turns the TV off.
He is comfortable in the dark room that glows with white light from the hallway.
He shuts his eyes, ready for whatever is to come next.
FADE TO WHITE:
