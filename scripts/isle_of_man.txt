Isle of Man by
Ben Younger
EXT. IRISH SEA - MORNING
The massive, twin-wakes of a high-speed ferry shoot 20 feet into the air as it cuts through the Irish Sea.
EXT. FERRY - CONTINUOUS
COLIN McMILLAN, a weathered-looking 42, stands on the furthest rear deck of the catamaran. He stares back at the open water behind him. Nothing but dark sea as far as you like. His eyes hold the same.
Behind him, though, it’s a very different world. We float up to the main deck to reveal hundreds of excited motorcyclists and their bikes being transported across the sea. But this is not Sturgis. The owners of these machines are not Harley riders. Not a single chap, open-face helmet or bandana in the bunch. Everyone wears one-piece, modern racing suits.
We hear German, Italian, French, Australian, Portuguese and Spanish being spoken - all of it passionately. It feels more pilgrimage than sporting event. Indeed, the place they are going is Mecca for sport-motorcyclists.
EXT. REAR DECK - CONTINUOUS
Colin CLIMBS OVER THE RAILING and looks straight down at the churning water below. Arms behind him, he holds himself over the massive wake. He just needs to let go of the railing.
VOICE
There it is!
The voice pulls him out of the darkness. He turns to look...
The camera soars up and over the ferry to reveal the Isle of Man. It’s ancient. Rocky cliffs give way to the sea. Verdant fields run right up to the edges where sheep graze. A large Mountain rises from the inland in the distance.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL - DAY
Colin exits the ferry in DOUGLAS with all his fellow pilgrims. Unlike everyone else around him, though, Colin’s excitement (if it exists at all) is muted. Bikes pass him on both sides as he walks off the boat. He carries a large back- pack - graphite tent poles protrude from the top.
A makeshift amusement park has been set up on the promenade. Rides and gaming booths are crammed onto the boardwalk. A massive LCD screen shows TT races from previous years.
Imagine a two-mile-long block party made up entirely of motorcyclists. Colin is unique in being alone here. This is very much a communal gathering.
EXT. ROAD - DAY
Colin walks on a two-lane road passing a campground on his right. It’s quickly filling up.
EXT. CAMPGROUND - LATER
Colin has staked out a small piece of grass and is just finishing making camp among hundreds of other bikers and spectators. He stands back and looks at his tent.
VOICE
Looks good, mate. Now let’s go watch Superbike practice!
A small but rowdy group walk past Colin. The ringleader, MARK, waves Colin to come with. And he does. Without a word. He walks with them, leaving all his possessions behind.
EXT. SMALL STREET - LATER
Colin and the group end up on a small street in Douglas.
WOMAN
You don’t have any mates with you?
Colin shakes his head, no.
WOMAN
You just came alone, then?
Colin nods.
MARK
Tell your new friend to pipe down. He’s driving me mad.
Everyone laughs. Colin smiles politely. The group head down an alley between two rows of attached homes. They climb under a broken fence then squeeze between a wall and a garage for a 30-foot shimmy and finally find themselves in...
EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
...a quaint little yard behind someone’s house. A tiny, old lady, NANCY, appears holding a garden hose.
NANCY
Mark, dear.
MARK
Hello, Nancy. How are you? Brought some friends with me this year.
Hope that’s alright.
NANCY
Of course. Would you all like some tea?
She’s gone before they can answer. They walk around the house onto the front lawn facing Bray Hill - a very narrow, steep, two-lane road with walls on either side. Colin suddenly comes alive. He finally looks engaged.
MAN
Do you know where we are?
COLIN
Bray Hill.
MAN
That’s right. So, you know the course?
COLIN
Years of watching those Duke videos. On TV it doesn’t look this... narrow.
MAN
Just wait. That’s not the only thing that doesn’t translate.
Colin moves toward the edge of the elevated lawn, looks over onto the street four feet below. Nancy comes out with tea.
MARK
So, who do you like then, Nancy?
NANCY
McGuiness will break the 134MPH lap but I’m keeping me eye on Connor Cummins. I think this might be his year.
Then, a faint noise in the distance. Colin’s head snaps up.
WOMAN
Here they come.
Colin strains to see up the hill as the sound gets louder and louder until...
A Superbike comes SCREAMING down Bray hill at 175MPH. It goes by so fast that by the time Colin turns his head the bike’s already at the intersection 200 yards away where the it BOTTOMS OUT spectacularly, SPARKS shooting off the exhaust can. It roars up the next hill. Gone.
Colin’s face goes blank, only this isn’t a muted feeling. This is pure shock. He looks at his arm - it’s covered in GOOSE-BUMPS.
MARK
That’s Donald. Bloody fast through here, ey? Especially for an Aussie.
The next bike comes screaming down the hill and the scene repeats itself. Colin is mesmerized...
EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
Colin walks back alone when he sees a crane-truck pass with CRASHED BIKES stacked like cord-wood. They aren’t race bikes. They’re street bikes with lights and turn signals. Colin turns and watches the truck drive off.
EXT. PROMENADE - EVENING
Colin passes the massive monitor we saw earlier. He stops dead in his tracks. On screen is a racer, wearing a distinct yellow helmet, tearing around the Isle back in 2000. This is JOEY DUNLOP - the greatest TT racer of all time.
Colin stands there silhouetted against the screen watching Joey win at the age of 49.
EXT. CAMPGROUND - LATER
Every square foot of the field is now covered with tents. Colin makes his way through the maze. He finally spots his own tent and reaches for the zipper.
VOICE
Sod off!!
Wrong tent. And off he goes, albeit, with a new understanding of the phrase.
INT. TENT - LATER
Colin lays out in his tent. He reaches into his bag and pulls out his iPad to watch The Roadracers - a black-and-white racing documentary from the 70’s. A young Joey Dunlop, with long hair, prepares his race-bike in a garage that could double for a barn.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
While Frank whittles money from his sponsor, Joey has to take a precious day away from his bikes to keep body and soul together. It’s a perfect day with a drying wind and time for the family to harvest the peat that will keep them warm in the winter.
Shot of Joey cutting peat out of the earth in Ireland. When Joey is on-screen everything else stops for Colin.
FADE OUT.
SHORT MONTAGE:
EXT. START/FINISH LINE - DAWN
The street in front of the grandstands, empty save for a lone street-cleaner.
In the paddock, mechanics wheel bikes toward the scrutineer garages.
On another part of the Island, marshals begin the huge task of roping off every intersection that intersects the course.
Fans start to gather at viewing sites, setting up chairs.
EXT. CAMPGROUND - MORNING
Colin is already drinking coffee as everyone else rises for the day’s races. The sound of the first bike going out for practice fills the air and everyone pauses.
Colin turns, following the sound until it’s gone.
EXT. PADDOCK - MORNING
Colin walks through the paddock which is laid out on a hill. The first row is filled with factory teams. They sport large tents with logos with the semis that brought the bikes over from the mainland, parked just behind. The riders have brand new leathers and the mechanics wear matching, branded clothes. Still, it’s nothing like a NASCAR event. It’s more like the Woodstock of motorcycle racing.
As you move down the hill, the factory teams give way to smaller outfits. The semis are replaced by small trailers similar to what your gardener uses. The riders are suiting up here as well, only their leathers have duct tape on them - mending from previous falls.
Their crew and mechanics are comprised of friends and family members. The bikes themselves have seen battle. Bodywork is bruised and battered.
These are the privateers and they make up the bulk of the entrants at the TT. Fans roam the paddock and are free to talk to any of the racers. Access is plentiful.
INT. PIT AREA - MORNING
Colin passes a mechanic working on a bike. A small radio is playing Starship’s “We Built This City.”
MECHANIC
Hey, mate. Give us a hand?
Colin jumps right in.
MECHANIC
Would you grab the...
But Colin already sees what’s happening. The mechanic is changing the rear wheel but has left the axle just out of arm’s reach. Colin grabs it but instead of handing it to the mechanic, he gets on the ground to help him insert it.
COLIN
Brake caliper’s off the hangar.
Colin places it back then sends the axle through the wheel with a satisfying thunk. Colin knows bikes. More importantly, we see it’s something he cares about. He’s actually talking.
MECHANIC
Thanks, mate.
COLIN
Never seen a brake-reservoir safety- wired before.
MECHANIC
Yeah. Safe than sorry. Only nut Malcolm has to worry about is himself. This course, you wouldn’t believe what it’s capable of shaking loose.
MALCOLM, the racer riding this bike, walks up.
MALCOLM
Nice work, Sean. See you converted someone else to the cause.
(shakes Colin’s hand) I’m the nut, apparently.
SARA
Finally. We’re calling it what it is. Refreshing.
MALCOLM
(points to the safety wire) Glen Duff is wicked bumpy. You think your fillings are gonna come out. Can’t see straight. Just bucking you off everywhere.
MECHANIC
I’ve seen exhausts come loose, rear- sets, even a clutch basket cover.
COLIN
You have the steering stabilizer max’d out?
MALCOLM
Nah. Can’t afford to give up the turn-in for the faster corners. All those high-speed direction changes. Setup here is just one big compromise.
(studies Colin) You a racer?
COLIN
No.
MALCOLM
What do you do back in the States, then?
COLIN
I’m in I.T.
MECHANIC
Well, you know a fair bit about racing for a computer nerd.
Malcolm’s wife, SARA, shows up with their three kids and her friend, KATHLEEN. She’s late 30’s, beautiful in spite of her decisions on wardrobe and hair this morning. If she ever tried, someone would be grievously injured.
MALCOLM
You bring the water?
SARA
Shit. Sorry, babe. Kids are driving me fookin mad. Who’s this, then?
MALCOLM
A good Samaritan.
SARA
I’m Sara, this is Kathleen.
COLIN
Hi. Colin.
Kathleen and Colin have instant heat. It’s uncomfortable and great and entirely not up to you.
SARA
Come to see the races, then?
COLIN
Yes. Been wanting to come here for a long time.
SARA
You and the 40,000 other people on the Isle right now. Welcome to the madness. What do you make of it so far?
COLIN
It’s insane.
SARA
(to Kathleen)
Smart one. Maybe he can talk some sense into Malcolm.
KATHLEEN
Good luck with that.
“We Built This City” ends and the Manx Radio TT announcers come on the air.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Welcome back to Manx Radio TT. One hour until the roads close for the Superstock race. If you have somewhere to be, time to get there.
KATHLEEN
Alright, I have to be going. Get a pint at Colours tonight?
MALCOLM
Can’t. Got a service call in Ramsey.
(to Colin)
Where you gonna watch from?
COLIN
Someone told me about a farm by Barregarrow.
MALCOLM
That’ll be good. Fast turn there. Blind. You best get moving. It’s a
COLIN
I don’t have a car. Was gonna hitch.
Kathleen thinks for a beat before speaking. Fuck it...
KATHLEEN
I’m heading that way. I can drop you there.
EXT. PADDOCK - LATER
Kathleen and Colin make their way out toward the parking lot.
COLIN
He has to make a service call? What does that mean?
KATHLEEN
He’s a plumber.
COLIN
And he’s taking a job tonight?
KATHLEEN
These aren’t Grand Prix racers with sponsorship deals.
COLIN
Right, but he’s gonna fix a toilet the night before the TT?
KATHLEEN
You take the work when it comes.
INT. CAR - LATER
They turn left onto the main road and drive by the start/finish line. They make their way past Nancy’s house.
COLIN
(recognizing it)
That’s where I was standing yesterday.
KATHLEEN
That’s good. Now you’re thoroughly familiar with 800 feet out of 37 1/2 miles.
COLIN
You know a lot about the TT.
KATHLEEN
If you live here, you know a lot about the TT.
EXT. TT COURSE - LATER
Traffic is now moving as they make their way along the course. You know we’re on the course because the road is lined with spectators. Miles and miles of them.
It’s quiet and charged between them. They take turns stealing furtive glances.
EXT. BARREGARROW FARMHOUSE - LATER
A gravel road brings them to this working farm that doubles as a campground during the TT fortnight. They park in front of an open garage where a group of men sit and sip tea and smoke cigarettes as Manx Radio plays.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
KATHLEEN
Okay. I have to run. You can get a bite here. Then, walk back down to the road. You can watch the race by the wall across from the church.
COLIN
How can I see you again?
She takes a beat. Measures him.
KATHLEEN
When do you leave?
COLIN
Day after tomorrow.
It relaxes her to know he’s not staying.
KATHLEEN
Call me later.
She scratches down her number on a scrap of paper.
INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin walks onto a small porch that has sandwiches, cake and tea set up. A group of WOMEN tend the food.
One is elderly, two are middle-aged and one is in her 20’s, hot in a Jersey (as in New) sorta way. She eyes Colin.
Colin peruses the food selection. Tuna or egg. The stereotype held regarding English food is nothing compared to the culinary crimes committed on this Island.
OLD WOMAN
What you got there, love?
COLIN
Egg sandwich and a coffee.
OLD WOMAN
That’s... 3 and 65.
Colin fumbles through the coins in his palm.
OLD WOMAN
Here, let me help you.
She picks the amount from his hand as he politely smiles.
EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS
Colin and a few other spectators approach the course from above. They pass through a gate and into a field that is completely EMPTY. Colin looks back at the sheep-filled field just above them. He turns to the man walking next to him.
COLIN
Why are there no sheep in this field?
SPECTATOR
Few years ago a rider crashed and they flew in the heli. Landed in one of the fields and spooked a horse. He jumped a fence and ran onto the course. Another rider hit him at 180. Cut the thing in half. Killed himself, too. Now it’s law. All livestock two fields back.
Little breathing room.
EXT. BARRAGARROW - LATER
This is a 150mph, blind left with a Church on the corner. Colin’s found a place on the stone wall near the exit of the corner along with hundreds of other spectators. Colin looks over at the woman next to him. Her shirt has come up revealing a tatoo on the small of her back that simply reads: Harder, Faster, Longer. Colin just nods to himself. Noted.
Then, that sound again. You can hear the bikes coming from very far away here. And with it, all other thoughts instantly disappear. In fact, everyone stops talking and cranes to see.
The sound grows louder and louder until the first bike comes through. The rider nails the apex by the church then lets the bike drift out on exit, right to the wall Colin is leaning against. He actually moves away before returning.
EXT. FIELD - LATER
Colin sits high above the course. The Irish sea, just beyond. Below him, bikes go by but without the fury of the sound and smell and exploding air it seems almost magical. The speed feels even more unreal at this distance.
INT. PUB - LATER
It sits on one of the faster bends outside of Crosby. The place is packed. Colin exits with a pint in his hand.
EXT. PATIO - CONTINUOUS
The patio literally touches the road. A bike comes by at an impossible speed. You can barely focus. Colin stops in his tracks.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And Ian Hutchinson has just broke the outright lap record with a
A cheer goes up on the patio. Colin’s lost in thought.
EXT. PATIO - LATER
Colin has found a spot in the corner. He’s in his own world now. Soaking it all up. But he’s not just a spectator like those around him. There’s a bit more behind those eyes now.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
With the Senior TT halfway finished McGuiness leads followed by Ian Hutchinson and Michael Dunlop.
A bike comes around the bend that sounds WAY OFF TUNE - it’s rider going no more than 80MPH. Compared to the speed of the other bikes he might as well be walking next to it. He’s looking down at his instruments trying to figure out what’s wrong. Water temp? Oil? Out of gas?
Another rider comes around - wide open throttle. At 170MPH you are traveling one football field per second. By the time you realize what’s happening it’s already over.
The CRASH is deafening. The bikes DISINTEGRATE on contact. The debris field goes on forever. Marshals run out onto the course. YELLOW FLAGS come out to alert approaching riders. Neither of the riders is moving. One of the bikes is on fire, burning in the middle of the road.
The sound of a glass can be heard dropping somewhere on the concrete patio as everyone goes silent.
Colin turns away from the crash before anyone and walks away.
EXT. PICKUP BED - LATER
Colin sits in the back with some farming tools. He stares out at the countryside, wind blowing across his face.
EXT. GRANDSTAND - AFTERNOON
Colin walks by the grandstand as awards are handed out. John McGuiness stands on the top step of the podium with 2nd and 3rd on either side of him. A huge crowd cheers.
EXT. PADDOCK - AFTERNOON
Colin walks past Malcolm’s pit - the racer they spoke with earlier. The team are all packing up very quietly. It’s morbid. Malcolm’s mechanic sits in a chair and just stares straight ahead. Sara and the children are nowhere to be seen.
INT. TENT - NIGHT
Colin lays on his back with the tent door still unzipped. He stares out at the stars, mind working overtime. He sits up straight and starts to gather his things.
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER
Colin stands inside the old-school booth. Colin is on the phone, Kathleen’s number in front of him.
COLIN
Hi. It’s Colin.
KATHLEEN (V.O.)
Hey.
COLIN
I’m really sorry about your friend.
KATHLEEN (V.O.)
Where are you?
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - LATER
Colin stands on the corner when Kathleen’s car pulls up.
INT. PUB - NIGHT
The pair sit in the back of a small pub. TT memorabilia line the walls. They sip on pints of Guinness.
COLIN
How’s Sara?
Kathleen’s look is answer enough.
KATHLEEN
The whole thing is insane. We all say it’s insane. No one denies it. Then, come May, we just forget that small detail and we do it again.
COLIN
I saw it happen.
KATHLEEN
You were there?
COLIN
Yeah.
KATHLEEN
What happened?
COLIN
Other rider came way off the pace but stayed on the racing line.
There was no way to avoid him. It wasn’t Malcolm’s fault at all.
KATHLEEN
Does it matter?
COLIN
No, I guess not.
Colin reaches across the table and covers her balled fist with his hand. She relaxes and tenses at the same time. She looks long and hard at him.
HARD CUT:
INT. KATHLEEN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
They fuck in the back seat. Don’t let the location define this for you. It’s about as intimate an encounter as you can imagine. Eye contact for days. It’s tender and animalistic all at once. They have the kind of chemistry that allows them to move seamlessly between the two.
INT. KATHLEEN'S CAR - LATER
They lie there, spent. Then the realization of what’s just happened sets in. Intimate or not, Kat just fucked a strange man in the back of her car. Social norms require a reaction.
KATHLEEN
I have to get going.
Stings a bit but he rallies.
COLIN
Yeah. Okay. Can you drop me back at the campsite?
KATHLEEN
Of course.
EXT. CAMPGROUND - LATER
Colin, out of the car, leans down and kisses Kat through her window. She doesn’t really kiss him back. Not like before.
COLIN
Hey. Come back for one second.
She relents, kisses him deeply. There’s something there and it’s the last thing she wants to deal with right now.
KATHLEEN
(nervous)
Nice meeting you. Good luck.
COLIN
With what?
KATHLEEN
I don’t know. I have to go.
She drives off.
EXT. DRAGON'S TAIL - MORNING - FLASHBACK
A forested road that sits on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, The Dragon’s Tail is known for packing 318 turns into 11 miles. It’s not unlike the TT course.
A Honda CBR1000RR tears into frame. Its rider dispatches one sport-bike after another. He’s in total control.
A State Police car perched on a fire-road sees the rider passing a Ducati on the outside. The trooper hits the lights and spins his tires on the dirt as he pulls out.
The rider turns to see the police car coming after him and TAKES OFF. If you thought he was pushing before you were wrong. He now treats the road as if it were a racetrack - knee down in every corner.
INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS
The Trooper grabs for the radio.
TROOPER
Heading south past mile 5 marker.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Do you have a license plate?
TROOPER
Uhhh, negative.
The Honda very quickly disappear into the distance.
EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - LATER
Those places you see off the interstate. 100 garages lined up in rows. The Honda pulls up to one, rider jumping off and opening the sliding garage door. He hustles the Honda inside, SLAMS the door shut, and removes his helmet...
Colin.
Though only a few years younger, he looks demonstrably healthier/happier here. He’s also giggling like an adolescent at the moment. He gets a hold of himself, then succumbs to the laughter once more, still buzzing from the chase.
Colin hits the light-switch revealing a makeshift motorcycle shop. Immaculate. Professional. Old racing-suits hang from the ceiling. One poster - it’s Joey Dunlop. Yellow helmet, mid-turn on a stone-lined road on the Isle of Man.
At the bottom of the poster it reads: 1952 - 2000
EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - LATER
Colin pulls up to the semi-attached tract home. Colin, now dressed in gym clothing, opens the trunk of his car and pulls out a RACQUETBALL RACKET.
He catches a glimpse of himself in the car window - he still has helmet hair. He stops and removes a WATER BOTTLE from the car, pours some of it over his head, mussing it up.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Colin walks in to find his kitchen filled with SMOKE. His daughter, Melissa (Mel), 15, huge nerd, but recently aware of her attractiveness (and more importantly how to use it) is failing spectacularly at making a tuna melt.
MEL
Hey, Dad. How was racquetball?
COLIN
Yeah. Good. What did you do?
MEL
I cooked. Never a good idea. I’ll be the first to say it. But if you’re gonna be late, I’m still gonna need to eat. It’s just the natural order of things. You’re lucky I’m not a minor or they’d probably take me away for this.
COLIN
Why you think I never left you alone as a kid? Couldn’t find a baby-sitter who could keep up.
Colin moves in closer. One side of the tuna-melt is burned beyond recognition. Mel is removing the burnt piece of bread.
MEL
Can you tell me a story about how Mom was just as useless in the kitchen but you didn’t care because she was just so damn hot?
COLIN
Your Mom was a pretty decent cook. Sorry to disappoint. Mel. Open a window. I’m gonna go take a shower.
MEL
Hey, Dad...
Her tone and look instantly change with these two words.
No.
COLIN
MEL
I didn’t even ask yet.
COLIN
Yeah, but it’s coming. I can feel it.
Dad!
MEL
COLIN
Go ahead. What?
MEL
Need you to sign an authorization letter for me.
COLIN
To do what?
MEL
Scuba diving class.
COLIN
We’re 400 miles from the Atlantic, babe. Where you scuba diving?
MEL
We start in a pool. Then we get our certification in a quarry.
COLIN
In a quarry? How deep?
MEL
I don’t know. Deep. 100 feet?
COLIN
No way. That’s insane.
MEL
Dad! The school is offering it as part of the phys-ed program. I’m not climbing a fence and sneaking in with my girlfriends.
COLIN
Let me think on it.
MEL
You’re kidding me... If I were a boy you’d let me go in a second!
COLIN
If you were a boy I’d chain you to a radiator and not let you out of the house until you were 30.
MEL
This is bullshit, and you know it!
She storms out of the room. Colin’s conflicted. The outburst visibly hurts him. He’s trying. Single dad shit.
EXT. PADDOCK - MORNING
The circus is packing up after another year. Colin walks past the vendors selling their last wares. He watches two OLDER MEN push a race-bike into a lorry with great care. One of them looks up, notices Colin, basically does a double-take.
MAN
Colin McMillan?
The other man looks up. Squints. Colin looks around. It’s as if he doesn’t want anyone to see this exchange.
MAN
(elated)
I can’t believe it. It is you! I was at the race at Sears Point in 2005. The one. I was there.
(to his friend)
He beat Miguel Duhamel, who was on a factory bike. 15 passes on the last lap. Every corner. Back and forth. Best race I’ve ever seen in me whole life.
COLIN
That was a hell of a battle.
MAN
What are ya doing here?
COLIN
I came to see the TT.
MAN 2
What’d you think?
COLIN
Incredible. Nothing like it.
MAN
It’s our Everest, really, isn’t it?
Colin smiles and nods. Quiet beat.
COLIN
Well, I have to get going. Plane to catch. Nice meeting you fellas.
He shakes their hands and walks off.
MAN 2
What happened to him?
MAN
No idea. He disappeared after that season. People talked about him being a future world champion, then nothing.
EXT. GRANDSTAND - MORNING
Colin, bags packed, sits on the top row. He can see the Mountain in the distance, paddock below him and a cemetery across the street. He gets up and starts down the stairs. Slowly at first, then two steps at a time.
EXT. THE MAGIC CHAIR - MORNING
A small, high-end children’s furniture store in Asheville, North Carolina. A black man in his 40’s, FISH, is on the phone intensely pacing the showroom floor.
FISH
What do you mean you’re staying?
INT. PHONE BOOTH - CONTINUOUS
COLIN
I’m staying. I’m moving here.
INT. THE MAGIC CHAIR - CONTINUOUS
Fish stops in his tracks, goes silent. A rich mother-and- daughter try to get his attention.
WOMAN
Excuse me, we’re looking for the Bonnet armoire in black. We went to PoshTots but they only...
Fish waves them off, sits down on a race-car bed.
FISH
Staying to do what?
Colin says nothing. We watch the realization creep across Fish’s face - equal parts terror and Christmas morning.
Fish?
COLIN
FISH
Yeah. I’m here.
COLIN
You think I’m crazy.
FISH
Whenever I think of the Isle of Man I think of those old, grainy NFL films. “The snow on Lambeau field would not stop Brett Favre on this day. This day was destiny.”
COLIN
You know what? It actually feels like that here. It’s real. I stood on the wall at Barregarrow.
FISH
So, what, you’re gonna take a leave from work?
I quit. When?
COLIN FISH
COLIN
Fish lays back on the race-car bed.
FISH
How you gonna learn the course?
COLIN
I have a whole year.
FISH
They say it takes three.
COLIN
Remember how long it took me to learn Road Atlanta? I was competitive after two practice sessions.
FISH
Road Atlanta is 2 1/2 miles long, not 37.
COLIN
FISH
You’re going racing again.
COLIN
Yeah. At 42.
Yeah.
FISH COLIN
(more silence)
Joey was 49 when he won in 2000.
FISH
They say age actually helps over there. Can’t be a loose cannon.
COLIN
You sayin I’m old?
FISH
I am. Yes.
Fish takes a beat. He thinks things through for a moment.
FISH
It’s an insane idea. I just need to say that. People die there. Four racers just this past week. You know. You were there.
COLIN
Everyone dies sometime.
FISH
Oh, now you’re Lee Marvin all of a sudden?
(beat, serious) Wait. Did you mean that?
Colin gets quiet. Embarrassed.
COLIN
No. I was kidding, Fish.
FISH
Sorry. I worry about you. (changes the subject)
Alright. What do you need from me?
COLIN
Sell everything. My truck, the bike, stands, trailer, genny, everything. Need enough to get a new bike, parts and a built motor.
FISH
Alright.
COLIN
And mail my kit.
FISH
Your kit?
COLIN
Leathers, boots, gloves, helmet.
FISH
Oh, your kit. Right. Look who’s learning the local language.
Cheers, mate. Just don’t show the Father your shillelagh.
They take a beat.
FISH
You sound different, brother. You sound good.
It wasn’t meant to hit hard. It does. Colin deflects.
COLIN
Thanks for buying my plane ticket. I never would have come on my own.
FISH
Yeah, well, you’re staying on your own.
INT. RENTAL CAR OFFICE - DAY
The WOMAN behind the desk hands Colin a set of keys.
RENTAL WOMAN
You familiar with left-side drive?
COLIN
Yeah. Been here a couple weeks now.
EXT. RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS
Colin is pulling out of the driveway. He looks mistakenly to his left and turns right into the path of an ONCOMING TRUCK.
The truck BLARES ON THE HORN as it SWERVES around Colin’s bumper. Close. The driver is swearing at him as he goes by. Colin looks over his shoulder to see the rental girl waving at him from inside the office. Strong start.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Colin’s on the TT course in a Ford Fiesta. Of course, he’s pushing the little econo-box as fast as it will go when a bike blows by him going at least 140MPH.
EXT. GLENLOUGH FARM - AFTERNOON
Colin pulls off the main road onto a long drive that ends in front of a modest farmhouse. Colin steps out of his car and looks around. It’s not long before a sheep dog comes running at him barking like mad.
JON (O.S.)
Can I help you?
JON MCCOWLEY, late 60’s, comes around the car wearing wading boots. He looks like he works for a living.
COLIN
Hi. Yeah. Your niece, Mary, sent me over.
JON
You a friend of Mary’s?
COLIN
Not exactly. Rented a car from her this morning and told her I was looking for work. She said you might need someone.
JON
She said that, huh? She fancy you?
COLIN
What?
JON
Probably. American and all. Seems exotic I guess. Who the hell understands women, anyway?
COLIN
Umm...
JON
You ever work on a farm before?
COLIN
No.
JON
When can you start?
Umm...
COLIN
JON
Be here tomorrow at 4:00.
COLIN
Yeah, I guess I can do that. That gives me the day to get...
JON
AM.
Colin just stands there. Jon doesn’t wait for an answer.
JON
Alright, I need to get cleaned up.
With that, Jon is off and gone leaving Colin standing there in the drive with the dog still looking up at him.
A sharp WHISTLE from Jon sends the dog running.
EXT. IOM CAMPGROUND - NIGHT
Colin’s tent is now the only one left. It glows in the otherwise large, dark, empty field.
INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS
A lantern illuminates the interior. Colin holds a map of the TT course which he begins to study with renewed interest.
EXT. CAMPGROUND - DAWN
It’s still dark as Colin packs up his tent and belongings.
INT. RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS
Colin passes the grandstand on his way to work. He slows down on Bray Hill and looks at the lawn he stood on a few short days ago. There’s no one on the road now. He gets on the gas and crosses into the oncoming lane like the racers did to square off the corner at the bottom of the hill.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN
Colin drives up and parks. Jon’s wife BRIDGET walks out of the farmhouse and shouts.
BRIDGET
Morning. You must be Colin.
COLIN
Yes.
BRIDGET
Bridget. They’re in the fields. Follow that path there.
Colin waves and heads off on foot.
EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS
Jon works the sheep with his dog. Through a series of WHISTLES the dog runs around the herd and pushes them where Jon wants them. It’s a near art-form.
Jon’s younger brother by a year, PETER MCCOWLEY, herds the errant sheep that the dog misses.
COLIN
Morning, Jon.
JON
This is the lad I was telling you about. No idea what his name is.
COLIN
Colin.
PETER
Hi. Peter.
Peter’s somewhat more affable than his brother.
PETER
I’m gonna have you start over in the barn. We’re going to be bringing in all the silage today so we need the floor cleaned up.
Broom’s inside.
Colin heads toward the large, three-walled structure.
INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
Well used. A lone cow stands inside. Colin approaches her.
COLIN
(petting her head)
Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing in here all by yourself?
She walks off. Colin turns to the task at hand. The floor is a mess - an ugly mix of old hay and cow manure. Colin looks down at his brand-new Nikes. No way.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: Colin’s Nikes, now fully wrapped in plastic bags as he cleans.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATER
Colin sits with Jon and Peter at a picnic table eating cheese sandwiches. Colin does not look put together anymore. He’s filthy now, sneakers destroyed, but happy.
COLIN
(mouth full) I was in I.T.
Jon and Peter look at one another. No clue. Colin finishes chewing then answers again.
COLIN
I was in I.T. Still nothing.
COLIN
Information technology.
...and still nothing.
JON
Did you get sacked?
COLIN
No.
PETER
So, what are you doing here?
Colin takes a beat before answering. It will be the first time he says it out loud.
COLIN
I’m training for next year’s TT.
This gets both brother’s immediate attention. They look at one another, and not in a good way.
PETER
You do any racing back in the States?
COLIN (CONT’D)
Yeah, back in the day. AMA series. It’s not like here with the TT, though. It’s all...
JON
...short circuits. Yeah, we know. What class? Superbike, Supersport?
COLIN
(surprised)
Jesus. Does everyone here know...
PETER
Man, woman and child.
COLIN
Superbike.
JON
You could be a bloody, MotoGP rider. Wouldn’t help you here. Not one bit. Racing the Mountain is not a transferrable skill-set, as it were. Real different, this.
PETER
Takes three years just to learn the course.
COLIN
(dismissive)
Yeah, I’ve heard that. I think I’ll be alright.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK
They are all washing up at an outdoor basin.
COLIN
So, what do people do around here? Seems dead with the racing gone.
PETER
There’s a great potential for boredom.
JON
Darts is very popular.
COLIN
Darts? Like, what you play at a bar?
Pub.
JON
PETER
Everyone watches.
COLIN
What do you mean ‘watches?’
INT. HOUSE - LATER
Jon, Peter, their wives, the dog and Colin sit in the living room watching darts on TV. It’s exactly what it sounds like. They go to commercial and Colin stands.
COLIN
Well, thanks very much for dinner. I’m gonna get going. Bridget, okay if I use the phone for a sec?
BRIDGET
Of course, love.
JON
Best be local. Don’t be calling America from the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Colin is on the phone leaving a message.
COLIN
Hey, Kathleen. It’s Colin. Left you a message yesterday. Hope you got it. Anyway, I decided to stay a bit longer. Wondering if you were around. I’d really like to see you again. Alright. Well, good night.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin walks outside and takes in the clear night sky.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
Driving along, Colin sees a pub up ahead. He pulls in.
INT. PUB - LATER
Colin walks in the front door. It’s packed. The same darts match is on the TV here as well. He walks to the bar.
COLIN
Grapefruit juice, please.
BARTENDER
What with?
COLIN
Just grapefruit juice.
Bartender pops open a small can. Not happy.
Two obviously DRUNK GIRLS at the end of the bar are watching this exchange, laughing. One of them, RYAN, we recognize as the girl from the farmhouse at Barregarrow. They approach.
RYAN
I know you.
COLIN
I’m sorry. I don’t...
RYAN
You were at the family’s campsite for TT. Me Gran had to show you how much three pounds sixty was.
BARTENDER
Here’s your fruit drink.
GIRLFRIEND
What you got there? Looks strong.
RYAN
Shane. Do you have an umbrella for our mate’s drink, here?
GIRLFRIEND
Next thing you know, he’ll be asking for tapiz.
She means tapas.
RYAN
What the hell are tapiz?
GIRLFRIEND
You know, Tapiz... tiny, little Mexican foods.
She ignores her friend and goes back to her prey.
RYAN
Not much of a drinker, are ya?
COLIN
Not really. She cozies up to him.
RYAN
Picked a hell of a place to visit.
COLIN
Yeah, I’m getting that.
INT. PUB - LATER
Colin does a shot with the two girls. He’s completely SHIT- FACED, playing darts. Ryan shows him how to throw. She stands right behind him holding his arm up. She whispers into his ear and we see her TONGUE dart out. Colin stops playing and turns toward her, holds her gaze.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Ryan, SLAMMED against the graffiti-strewn wall of one of the stalls. She and Colin are feverishly making out. It’s sloppy.
INT. PUB - CONTINUOUS
An irate man walks in the bar.
MAN
(to bartender) Where is she?
The bartender points to the bathroom.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
They pull away form each other for a moment. Colin has lipstick smeared across his face.
RYAN
Sweet, shy boy, huh? What a crock.
VOICE (O.S.)
Ryan!! Get out here!
RYAN
Shit! Stay here. Let me fix this.
INT. PUB - CONTINUOUS
Ryan walks out of the bathroom to find her boyfriend there.
MAN
What you been up to, love?
Nothin.
RYAN
She walks around him, tries to draw him away from the bathroom. He follows her but looks over his shoulder.
MAN
I hear ya been messin around in a very public way.
RYAN
What do you care? You been doing the same with Alice for months now!!
Colin walks out of the lady’s room, lipstick and all.
RYAN
Ahh, shit.
Colin sees the guy clocking him and instead of diffusing the situation... let’s the alcohol talk.
COLIN
What are you looking at?
Colin walks by the guy who grabs him by the arm. Colin instantly swings, smashing his nose. There is RAGE there that we have not seen. His BUDDY grabs a BEER BOTTLE off a table and swings it at Colin’s head. LIGHTS OUT.
EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
A modern, large building and a real contrast to the architecture found on the rest of the island.
INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Colin sits on a table wincing as Kathleen, stitches his head. Colin yells out as she pulls the thread through his scalp.
She grabs a syringe and injects more anesthetic.
COLIN
I didn’t know nurses were allowed to do this.
KATHLEEN
They aren’t. I’m a PA. (off Colin’s look) Physician’s assistant.
COLIN
Never heard of that.
KATHLEEN
They have them in the States. Two extra years of school.
COLIN
Why not just be a doctor, then?
KATHLEEN
(stops working)
I don’t know. Why shag some local’s girlfriend in the bathroom of a pub and then get your clock cleaned?
Things just happen I guess.
COLIN
I didn’t shag her.
Kathleen moves to grab some gauze. He turns to watch her and we see that she’s SHAVED A GOOD SECTION OF HIS SCALP.
KATHLEEN
(annoyed)
What are you even doing here? I thought you were leaving.
A nurse walks in disrupting the moment. Kathleen leaves.
INT. HOSPITAL - ADMINISTRATION DESK - LATER
Colin is filling out paperwork when Kathleen walks by. Colin runs after Kathleen who wasn’t exactly waiting for him.
ADMIN
Wait. Your receipt.
EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
Colin runs up next to her.
COLIN
Do you want to go get a coffee?
KATHLEEN
(points to lipstick)
I think you’ve had enough female companionship for one evening.
COLIN
(wiping it off)
It was a strange night. Not my usual thing.
KATHLEEN
Right. Got it.
She walks to her car. He lets her go. INT. KITCHEN - MORNING - FLASHBACK
Mel, running around preparing to leave for the day, takes a sip of her coffee then yells upstairs.
MEL
Dad! Mug or thermos?
COLIN (O.S.)
Mug. Have a coffee with me before you leave.
MEL
I’m gonna be late for school.
Colin walks in. Mel hands him his coffee. Colin adds three sugars and enough milk to fill a cereal bowl.
MEL (CONT’D)
I will never understand how you can drink it like that.
COLIN
And I’ll never understand how a 16yr-old high-school girl drinks black coffee like she’s a foreman at a steel foundry.
MEL
High school I get, but what does my being a girl have to do with anything?
Colin stumbles for a sec. She’s right.
COLIN
I just meant that...
MEL
I’m messing with you. It is weird. I think I worked in a steel mill in a past life. But not as a foreman. I was the one with the space suit and the pole standing in front of the molten metal thing’y.
She kisses him on the cheek and starts to head out.
COLIN (CONT’D)
Mel. Hang on a second.
She turns back. His voice warrants it.
No.
MEL
COLIN
What? I didn’t even ask yet.
MEL
Yeah, but it’s coming. I can feel it.
COLIN
I was gonna ask if you wanted to drive the Alfa to school. But that’s cool. Another time.
MEL
(genuine shock)
Are you kidding? I don’t know if you’re kidding.
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
A 1981 GTV6 sits in the dark. The door opens letting the sunlight spill across the red car.
INT. ALFA - CONTINUOUS
Mel drives her father’s car, smiling ear to ear. Colin looks at his daughter as much as he does the road. It’s a stick and she rushes the 3rd to 4th shift, hanging it up a little.
MEL
Shit. Sorry.
COLIN
It’s okay. Just think of it as two shifts. Down to neutral then down again to fourth. Don’t rush it.
INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT - MORNING
Small but clean. Low ceilings and barely furnished. Colin looks around. The realtor is there with him.
REALTOR
There’s not really a big pitch. What do you think?
COLIN
How far are we from Glen Vine?
REALTOR
Not close at all. Why?
COLIN
That’s where I work.
REALTOR
Oh. Well, I have flats a lot closer than this.
COLIN
No. I want as long a commute as possible.
REALTOR
Okay... I can show you a few places in Belfast if you’re interested.
INT. WESTERN UNION - DAY
Colin picks up an envelope of cash. A note inside simply says, “Go Packers.”
INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT - DAY
Colin rips open the box with his racing suit in it. He holds it up, smells it. Reunited.
EXT. TOMMY LEONARD’S HONDA - DAY
Colin gets out of a cab holding his helmet and wearing his racing-suit hanging off his waist.
INT. TOMMY LEONARD’S HONDA - CONTINUOUS
Colin walks through a showroom of brand-new sport-bikes. A salesman approaches.
SALESMAN
Can I help you?
COLIN
Yeah. I need a bike.
SALESMAN
And a barber.
Takes Colin a second to remember his hair.
COLIN
Oh, right. Long story.
SALESMAN
What are you riding now?
COLIN
I don’t have a bike. That’s why I’m here.
SALESMAN
(laughs)
Coming in wearing the full kit kind of puts you at a disadvantage as far as the negotiation goes, don’t you think?
Colin thinks about this for the first time.
EXT. GARAGE - LATER
Colin and the salesman stand outside in front of a brand-new idling Honda Fireblade - a 1000cc super-bike.
SALESMAN
Break her in slowly. You’ve got the time, so. Engine will be in better shape come April when you rebuild it for the TT.
Colin gets on, blips the throttle, clicks her into gear.
SALESMAN
And don’t forget, it’s left-side drive here.
Colin smiles, flips his visor down and pulls into traffic.
EXT. TT COURSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin’s on a bike riding the TT course. Finally.
He rides briskly, passing every car he comes upon as he makes his way around more than once. The sunlight fades as we begin to learn the course with him.
Start/Finish line. Union Mills, Crosby, Doran’s Bends, Glen Helen, Barregarrow, Ramsey, The Mountain Section...
EXT. MOUNTAIN SECTION - SUNSET
Colin stands looking at the life-size bronze sculpture of JOEY DUNLOP on his Honda. Joey sits there, immortalized, overlooking the course as the sun sets over the Irish Sea.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: MAP - Glen Vine has been highlighted with the word:
Farm. Across the map, another highlighted circle: House
Colin’s moved his few things in. The place looks better. He’s changed out the fluorescents for tungsten bulbs. Warmth. The Joey poster from his garage now resides on the kitchen wall.
We find Colin sitting just below it, quietly eating a sandwich, watching a TT documentary. A medic is being interviewed.
MEDIC
It’s a celebration of the human spirit. Really, there is no rationale for doing this. It’s just human beings exploring their environment. Pure human spirit.
EXT. FARMER’S MARKET - DAY
Colin shops for vegetables in the large open-air market. A sign on the wall proclaims: CLOSED TUESDAYS EXCEPT TT WEEK.
He comes around a corner and sees Kathleen going through a pile of potatoes. He hesitates before walking up to her.
COLIN
You don’t want those.
She recognizes him this time around, and she can’t help but let loose a brief moment of not only recognition, but also joy. Not to worry. It quickly disappears.
KATHLEEN
No? Why not?
COLIN
(points to another stall) Because there are new potatoes over there.
KATHLEEN
Good. Someone can finally explain this to me. What exactly are new potatoes?
COLIN
They’re potatoes that have just been plucked from the plant. Lots of nutrients.
(picks up a potato)
Long-stored potatoes get pulled up with the whole plant from the ground and then they’re cured in a warehouse. They can last 6 months that way. Not as good. Not as good for you.
KATHLEEN
This how you picked up that girl who’s boyfriend beat you up? Gave her some veg advice? Origins of broccoli?
COLIN
Asparagus.
KATHLEEN
Much sexier.
COLIN
I was hoping to get you at heirloom tomatoes but you were just lingering here with the starch.
Kathleen finally breaks, laughs out loud, then walks off.
INT. PUB - AFTERNOON
Kathleen and Colin sit at a table.
KATHLEEN
What do you do back in North Carolina?
COLIN
I’m in I.T. Work for an insurance company. Network administration. Email support.
KATHLEEN
And you like it?
COLIN
Not really. I’m good at it, though.
KATHLEEN
And so, you’re taking a sabbatical to follow your true passion of potato farming?
COLIN
Just trying something different. I do like working with my hands, though. I guess that describes your job, too, huh?
KATHLEEN
Yeah, it does. I don’t think I’ve ever described it that way, but it’s true. It is very hands-on.
COLIN
You like your work?
She’s not asked that often. Guard comes down a bit more.
KATHLEEN
I do. I like it a lot.
COLIN
That’s good because you would make the worst hairdresser of all time. I still can’t leave the house. But I guess that’s what you wanted.
Kathleen has that moment where a woman realizes she likes a man, then wonders what’s wrong with him if he’s single.
KATHLEEN
You married?
COLIN
I was.
KATHLEEN
What happened?
COLIN
She’s gone.
KATHLEEN
I’m sorry.
COLIN
It’s okay. Long time ago.
KATHLEEN
Any kids?
COLIN
(smiles) Yeah. One.
Boy?
KATHLEEN
COLIN
Girl. Melissa.
KATHLEEN
How old?
COLIN
KATHLEEN
And she’s back home?
COLIN
Yeah. In Asheville. What about you?
KATHLEEN
Not married. No kids.
COLIN
You want some?
KATHLEEN
Is that an offer?
Colin laughs. Nervously.
KATHLEEN (CONT’D)
Relax. You’re too old for me. (beat, serious)
You like being a father?
COLIN
Yeah. Best thing I’ve ever done with my life.
INT. KITCHEN - DAWN
Colin’s up at sunrise, drinking coffee in his racing suit.
EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
He comes out of the house and walks into the middle of the street. From afar he hears the SOUND OF A RACE-BIKE.
It’s JOEY. Yellow helmet on a Honda RC51. Unmistakable.
Colin spins 180 degrees as Joey screams by, but there’s nothing. Only Colin and his fantasy.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Colin re-defines the work commute as he blasts through the Manx countryside at triple-digit speeds. He carefully chooses when to use the whole road, otherwise staying in his lane.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
Colin pulls up on the new bike. Peter greets him.
PETER
That’s a piece of kit. (yells toward house)
Jon, come have a look! He hasn’t seen one of these newer ones up close I don’t think.
Jon ambles out and we see a small but noticeable flash of joy cross his face, then quickly disappear.
PETER
Looks the business, ay?
JON
Looks like a tart’s handbag.
The three men stand there looking at the bike. Jon looks at Colin. You can tell he’s worried about him.
PETER
You find a place?
COLIN
Yeah. In Ramsey.
JON
That’s pretty far.
COLIN
By design. I’m gonna learn the course riding to work. Go over the Mountain and up through Douglas.
Then go north and ride the other half of the course on the way home.
Jon and Peter glance at one another again.
COLIN
(annoyed)
Why do you guys look at each other like that every time I mention the TT? Like they’re about to release the Kraken? It doesn’t help, you know - the drama. If you have something to say, then say it.
Neither brother answers him. They head toward the barn.
EXT. TT COURSE - AFTERNOON
Colin is standing on the side of the road at the Bends outside of Glen Helen. Colin takes notes on an iPad alongside a sketch he’s made of the corner.
CLOSE ON: Colin’s iPad.
Mile 16. Glen Helen Bends. Double left. Take them as one. Turn in at large white wall. Get as close as possible. Keep it on longer than you think. Opens up at exit.
INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
All of Colin’s sketches of the different corners are taped to the walls along with a large, marked-up map of the course.
Colin sits in front of the TV playing TT Super-bikes on his X- Box - a very realistic video game of the course. He crashes frequently as he tries to memorize the 264 corners
encountered in a single lap.
EXT. ROAD - DAY
Colin is flying down Sulby Straight and begins to slow for Ballaugh Bridge - one of the few places on the course the bikes get airborne. At 25 mph you would leave the ground here, but Colin is doing 50.
Right at the moment he hits the jump, he realizes his mistake and backs off the throttle. Too late. Colin is thrown forward and comes down on the windscreen, SHATTERING it. He slowly lowers himself back onto the seat. This is what racers call “having a moment.”
EXT. DOORSTEP - AFTERNOON
Colin stands at the front door of a modest home, helmet in hand. A woman opens the door. She’s a sprightly 68; pretty with sharp eyes. This is Kathleen’s mother, MEREDITH.
MEREDITH
Hi. You must be Colin. Come on in.
COLIN
(nervous)
Hi. Nice to meet you.
MEREDITH
Relax. This isn’t a “meet her mother” situation. Kat asked me to get the door. I’m on my way.
She moves toward the hall closet where she grabs a sweater.
MEREDITH
Good luck getting her on that fucking bike, though.
She takes a good look at Colin before she walks out the door.
MEREDITH
I get it now.
Kathleen catches the last bit and just looks on in wonder, smiling at her mother’s forwardness. Then, serious...
KATHLEEN
Mum. What are you doing?
MEREDITH
Living a life. Give me a break, would ya?
Meredith leaves. Kathleen points to the helmet.
KATHLEEN
She’s right about one thing. You can leave that here.
He walks over and grabs her. They kiss. It’s still there. Meredith walks back in. They jump away from one another.
MEREDITH
Shit. Sorry. Forgot me lunch. Carry on, then. I’ll only be a second.
EXT. KATHLEEN’S HOUSE - LATER
Kathleen notices Colin’s smashed windscreen.
KATHLEEN
Glad to see my instincts are still intact.
COLIN
That? No. That... wasn’t even. I don’t know how that happened.
INT. KATHLEEN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Colin and Kathleen drive through the countryside. We Built This City plays on the radio.
COLIN
Can you tell me why this song plays every day, 12 times a day?
KATHLEEN
You’ve been here a little while now. Isn’t it obvious that Douglas was built on Rock N Roll?
They pass over a small bridge and Kathleen looks toward it.
KATHLEEN
Hello fairies.
(beat, waiting for Colin) Say hello to the fairies.
COLIN
Uhh, no.
Kathleen SLAMS the brakes hard enough to lock Colin’s belt.
KATHLEEN
You have to say hello to the fairies at the bloody fairy bridge. People been doin it for 500 years. It’s tradition.
COLIN
Hello, fairies. Hello, fairies! Christ, you’re more superstitious than half the racers I know.
This gets her attention. She turns and looks at him.
KATHLEEN
You a racer?
COLIN
Used to be. Not anymore.
No response here. She just keeps on driving.
EXT. MAUGHOLD HEAD - LATER
A bluff overlooking the sea with a lighthouse perched on the edge. They park by a church just down the road and walk through an old cemetery. Neither speak until...
COLIN
Was it the fairies? I promise I’ll say hello from here on out.
Kathleen ignores him. Keeps walking.
EXT. CLIFF - LATER
Kathleen guides them up toward a rise with some large boulders. On the other side is a cliff with a 1,000ft vertical. Birds fly at different altitudes below them creating a dizzying visual. Colin grabs at the rock wall. Kathleen might as well be in her living room.
KATHLEEN
I’ve got a question for you. The racers that come into hospital - well the ones that make it there, anyway... I treat them. Horrific injuries. Compound fractures, missing limbs, massive internal bleeding. They die here. Every year. 248 since this madness started. I know everyone loves the TT and it’s good for the economy and all that shite, but, really, it’s enough already.
COLIN
Was there a question in there?
KATHLEEN
Right. Are you here to race?
COLIN
I am.
KATHLEEN
You have a daughter and a career. Why risk it? What’s wrong with you?
COLIN
Why do anything? Why climb Everest? It’s human beings exploring their environment.
He’s spitting back the line he heard in the doc.
KATHLEEN
That’s your answer? It sounds like something you read off a Patagonia jacket.
Colin says nothing.
KATHLEEN
So, you came here to die?
COLIN
No. I came here to live.
KATHLEEN
(laughs)
Oh, right. Been slowly dying on the inside all these years but this is your chance to finally live fully for the first time in your life.
COLIN
Something like that. Yeah.
KATHLEEN
Yeah... you got the wrong woman. Should have just told me up front. Could have saved us both the time.
EXT. KATHLEEN'S HOUSE - LATER
Colin stands outside. Kat comes out and hands him his helmet.
KATHLEEN
Thanks. I had a nice time.
She walks back in leaving him standing there in the driveway.
INT. KATHLEEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Meredith peeks her head out of the kitchen.
MEREDITH
What happened?
KATHLEEN
He’s here to race the TT.
Meredith instantly understands what this means.
INT. BARN - DAY
The three men are bringing hay bales in and stacking them.
PETER
You alright, lad? Awfully quiet today.
COLIN
I met someone.
PETER
Well, that’s nice.
COLIN
She doesn’t want to see me again.
JON
Sensible woman, then.
Ignoring Jon, Colin points to a large, stainless-steel harness hanging on the wall.
COLIN
What’s that thing?
PETER
It’s a calving jack. For ratcheting a calf out.
COLIN
Why would you ever do that?
PETER
They can get stuck sometimes. Especially the Belgian Blue’s. Narrow hips.
COLIN
That’s so technologically advanced of you, Jon. I can’t believe you even allow it on the property.
(MORE)
COLIN (cont'd)
I figured you just pulled the calf out with your teeth while wearing a kilt.
EXT. TT COURSE - DUSK
Colin’s going much faster now. He treats the road like it’s closed for TT - crossing into the oncoming lane of traffic on every corner. Coming down off the Mountain Colin slows his pace and within seconds a POLICE BIKE comes up behind him.
EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUOUS
The cop, KEVIN FENDER, 50, is a large man. He’s upset as he looks at Colin’s paperwork.
FENDER
So you come for the TT and stay on for a few extra weeks to play racer?
COLIN
I’m not playing anything. Learning the course for next year.
FENDER
You race back home?
COLIN
Used to.
AMA?
Colin nods.
FENDER
FENDER
What class?
COLIN
Superbike.
FENDER
So, you like the Fireblade?
COLIN
(surprised at turn) Yeah... A lot.
Fender nods, then begins to write him up.
COLIN
Wait, you’re still giving me a ticket? Are you kidding me?
FENDER
It’s a summons. And I’m giving it to you because I don’t want to see you get yourself killed. Takes three years to learn the course.
COLIN
You don’t say. Haven’t heard that before.
Fender looks up.
FENDER
You taking the piss?
COLIN
No, sir.
FENDER
Slow down. Three moving violations here as a non-resident and they take your driving privileges away. They can even boot you.
COLIN
Boot me?
FENDER
Send you packing, laddy. Back to the States as it were.
Fender hands him the summons.
FENDER
And that’s your Uncle Bob.
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
Colin’s having lunch with Jon and Peter. Jon is looking at the summons. Bridget is tidying up at the sink.
PETER
I’m gonna make tea.
COLIN
I got it. Let me do something. (to Jon)
Do you know him?
JON
Yeah. Used to race himself. Pretty quick. Top-10 finish one year. 8th I think.
Jon watches Colin like a hawk as he assembles all the necessary items for tea.
COLIN
Can you talk to him?
JON
He strongly dislikes me.
COLIN
(sotto) You’re kidding.
Colin places the tea-bag in the mug then goes for the water.
JON
Hey! Milk in first.
COLIN
Huh?
JON
Milk. In. First.
Colin turns and looks at him.
COLIN
I actually don’t know if you’re joking.
BRIDGET
He’s not joking.
JON
Put the hot water in first and you get a mixture. If you put the milk in first, then the hot water, you end up with an emulsion; which is a far better result.
Colin does it the way Jon says, brings tea over.
JON
He’s right, though. What he said. You can’t learn the course this way.
COLIN
I am learning it.
JON
No. You think you are but you’re not - which is even more dangerous.
Colin, annoyed, waits for further explanation.
JON
It’s impossible to learn properly when the road’s open to traffic. You’ll never get the right line.
(MORE)
JON (cont'd)
There’s straightaways that become long sweepers at 170MPH, and linked bends that become straights when you’re riding down the center of the road. Not to mention it’s not flat like a short-circuit. It’s crowned for drainage and such.
COLIN
So?
JON
So you finish every bloody corner off-camber. How many corners are there in one lap of the course?
COLIN
JON
Right. And you’re gonna have to re- learn every one of them come June.
COLIN
I’m not trying to learn the line from the saddle. I’m learning it from the roadside - stopping and studying each corner. And you would be surprised how accurate the video game is. Every corner is perfectly modeled...
JON
The video game?? Colin. You got no business here. I tell you this because I don’t want to see you hurt.
COLIN
There’s only one fast line around a circuit. This one’s just gonna take more time. It’s science, Jon.
JON
That’s the last thing it is. Black science, maybe; but it’s closer to witchcraft if you want to know.
(matter of fact)
You’ll die before you learn the course this way.
COLIN
Thanks. If I need any more racing advice from a farmer I’ll be sure to come back to you.
Colin gets up and walks out the back door.
EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT
Big, beautiful home on a tree-lined street. The door of the house is open and we see a middle-aged couple standing in the doorway, their teenage son just behind them.
Colin and Mel are quickly moving away from the door toward Colin’s car parked in front. Mel can’t get there fast enough.
MEL
Did you call Michelle’s parents?!
COLIN
No. I went to her house.
MEL
Oh my god!! Dad!!! What the fuck!??
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
Mel gets in the passenger seat, keeping her face turned away from the house, the front door still open.
COLIN
Do you have any idea how terrified I was when Mrs. Oliver told me you weren’t there? I didn’t know where you were.
Mel starts crying.
MEL
Just go! Drive!!
COLIN
What do you care so much about what they think? I don’t give a shit about these people.
MEL
Or me, obviously!! (beat)
I need to find Mom. She’ll understand.
EXT. ROAD - EARLY MORNING
Colin rides through a small town. It’s early still and the traffic is light. ANOTHER BIKE comes flying past. Colin immediately gives chase. This rider is experienced and fast. Knows his way around. Colin’s taking chances to keep up.
EXT. BALLACRYE - CONTINUOUS
Colin has never come through here at speed before. At anything less than race-pace the rise at Ballacrye is a benign hump in the road. You wouldn’t even know it was there. At 160mph IT’S A RAMP. Colin isn’t ready for what comes next.
Colin’s bike TAKES OFF. As he sails through the air the bike’s wheels come out of alignment. When he lands they are on different axis. The result is the bike SNAPPING itself straight, throwing Colin up in the air like a bucking bull.
He squirms back into the saddle just as a car PULLS OUT of a driveway. Colin SHOVES the bars to avoid the car, which he does. But it sends him hurtling toward the opposite side of the road. He leans the bike back as hard as he can. Almost makes it, too; but his front tire just kisses the curb.
The bike instantly FLIPS UP in the air and CARTWHEELS down the road, tearing itself to pieces.
Colin slides across the road and SLAMS into the curb, feet first. His heel SHATTERS on impact. He’s then thrown up in the air and TUMBLES across a yard until he is violently stopped by a STONE WALL. He crumbles into a heap and lies still. His bike sits in the middle of the road, SMOKING.
CLOSE ON: Colin’s face. The sun dapples through the trees into his eyes which are now tearing up. He passes out.
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Kathleen walks through the normal bustle of a weekday morning in the ER when the doors to the ambulance-bay slam open.
Colin is pushed in on a gurney by two EMT’s. She doesn’t realize that it’s him. A doctor rushes over.
EMT
Motorbike. Hit a wall. Really weak pulse.
DOCTOR
How much time since the wreck?
EMT
DOCTOR
Was he conscious when you got to him?
No.
EMT
DOCTOR
Let’s stabilize him and get a cat- scan.
Kathleen rushes over to a medical cabinet for supplies.
DOCTOR (O.S.)
Name?
EMT (O.S.)
McMillan. First name Colin.
Kathleen, hands full, stops moving and stares straight ahead.
INT. HOSPITAL BED - NIGHT
Colin opens his eyes and surveys himself. He’s a mess. Barely lifting his head he’s able to see PINS AND RODS sticking out of his foot and a tube going into his chest cavity. The last thing he sees before passing out is that he’s lost the PINKIE FINGER on his left hand.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Colin walks down the hallway where he sees a group of Mel’s friends standing in a circle. Some are crying, others speak in hushed tones. When they see Colin, they turn to face him and everyone goes quiet. One friend speaks up.
FRIEND
Mr. McMillan... He walks right past her.
INT. HOSPITAL - NURSE’S STATION - NIGHT
Kathleen stands at the desk, phone in her hand.
KATHLEEN
Yes. I’m calling on behalf of Colin McMillan. I’m trying to find Melissa. His daughter. We can’t find a number for her.
(beat) What?
Kathleen stares straight ahead as she listens.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Colin is frantic, looking into different rooms. A DOCTOR standing at the nurse’s station notices him.
DOCTOR
Excuse me. Mr. McMillan? Excuse me.
Colin ignores him. Keeps looking.
DOCTOR
Are you Mr. McMillan?
COLIN
(turns)
Where is she? Is she here? I just wanna see her before you say anything.
DOCTOR
Mr. McMillan...
COLIN
Is she here??
DOCTOR
No.
COLIN
Is she dead?
DOCTOR
Why don’t you come sit over...
COLIN
Is she dead?
DOCTOR
Yes.
Colin loses his legs, sliding against the wall until he’s sitting on the white, epoxy floor. A detective comes forward.
COLIN
What happened?
COP
A drunk driver hit her on Rt 26. Crossed the double yellow. Four times over the limit.
Colin considers this.
COLIN
Where is he?
COP
She. Died at the scene.
Colin has no other questions.
FADE OUT.
INT. HOSPITAL BED - MORNING
Colin is awake, staring out the window. Kathleen walks in.
KATHLEEN
Quite a move to get me to see you again. You’re a massive idiot.
She reaches for his chart, but he rattles it off for her.
COLIN
Broke three ribs, punctured my lung, shattered my heel, chipped my pelvis, lacerated my kidney. Didn’t know you could actually pee blood.
(holds up left hand)
Oh, and I have one less finger.
He’s all smiles until he realizes what he’s just described is him. His smile disappears, replaced with fear.
KATHLEEN
Didn’t realize you were such a winge-bag. I’ll check in on you later.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Kathleen walks out of the room, leans against the wall and does everything she can not to break down.
FADE OUT.
MONTAGE
Colin in bed: eating, sleeping, staring out the window. Colin FaceTiming with Fish.
Peter, Jennifer and Bridget visit Colin - no Jon. Kathleen sitting with Colin at night, reading to him. END MONTAGE
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Colder now. People are wearing overcoats and sweaters. It never snows here but it gets chilly and wet this time of year. There’s a Christmas tree in the lobby.
INT. REHAB ROOM - DAY
Colin is lying on a gurney with electrical stims attached to his feet and hand. Kathleen comes in.
KATHLEEN
Doctor said the x-rays look good.
COLIN
Better than new. (points to his leg)
Titanium. Can’t afford it for my bike but I got it in my foot.
Kathleen is standing next to the bed. Colin takes her hand in his. She stares back at him until she can’t - pulls away.
KATHLEEN
Are you going to stop racing?
COLIN
On public roads in the middle of rush hour? Absolutely.
Kathleen studies him for a moment.
KATHLEEN
When a farmer comes in to see me, here, I take them very, very seriously. They’re not setting foot in a doctor’s office unless something massive has happened. You lot are no different.
COLIN
Racers are the same as farmers?
KATHLEEN
Basically. Farmers don’t want to admit what’s happened. Racers don’t want to admit what’s going to happen. Either way, you’re dealing with a delusional man. I can’t be with you if you’re going to race. I told you that from the beginning.
INT. NURSE’S STATION - NIGHT
Colin sits at one of the desktop computers used for billing and admissions wearing a hospital gown.
CLOSE ON: Computer. Colin is online shopping for replacement parts for his bike. Windscreen, exhaust canister, etc.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Colin’s watching V-Four Victory - an old, grainy motorcycle race film from the 70’s detailing Joey’s victories on the Isle of Man with Honda.
Jon knocks on the open door and sticks his head in the room. Between Colin’s surprise and Jon’s awkwardness, it’s clear this is the first time he’s paid Colin a visit.
COLIN
Jon. Hey.
JON
Jennifer asked me to bring this over. It’s pot pie, I think.
He shakily sets it down on the table. He’s been drinking.
COLIN
Thanks.
JON
Sorry I haven’t come round. Things have been real busy at the farm.
COLIN
Yeah, of course. No worries.
JON
You alright, then?
COLIN
Yeah. Much better. Should be out of here in the next week or so.
JON
Been thinking about the crash, then?
COLIN
Every minute.
JON
Well, at least you learned your lesson.
Colin touches on angry but keeps it in check.
COLIN
Oh yeah? What lesson is that?
JON
Come on, lad. I’ve been telling you for months now, you can’t learn the Mountain by drawing pictures from the side of the road.
The anger begins to surface.
COLIN
So, what? I should just pack it in and go home now?
JON
You’re lucky you get to go home at all, really. Lucky as hell. Yeah, I figure you’re done here.
COLIN
I hadn’t really thought it through.
JON
Of course you have. Do you good to listen to it.
COLIN
Listen to what?
JON
(leans in close)
The fear. It’s just trying to save you. It’s okay to be afraid.
COLIN
You’re drunk. Get out.
JON
I don’t understand. Did you really think you could just waltz in here and race the TT? How?
COLIN
Get out of my room, Jon.
JON
...by playing video games?
COLIN
Jon...
JON
Look at you. You’re done.
COLIN
Get out!!
A nurse comes in and stands there trying to figure out what’s happening. Jon leaves before being asked again.
EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING
Colin is wheeled out by Peter and Bridget, then helped into the waiting car. He looks back at the hospital.
INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT - LATER
Colin is finally back home. Peter stands near the door watching him hobble around.
PETER
You sure you don’t want me to stay and help you get settled in?
COLIN
No, I’m good. Thanks.
PETER
Okay. I’ll check in on you tomorrow after work.
Colin stands there looking at his marked map of the course. He raises one of his crutches and swings it at a pile of DVD’s SMASHING them to the floor.
INT. KITCHEN - LATER
Sitting at the table, Colin makes his tea exactly as Jon explained. He drinks while staring at the poster of Joey.
EXT. STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Garage door open. That same poster of Joey on the wall.
It’s a warm night and the glow from inside surrounds him as he stares at his bike, perched in the center of the room.
Fish sits in a lawn chair.
FISH
You know, you can leave it at the house now.
Colin’s not ready to hear it. Fish quickly backtracks.
FISH (CONT’D)
Also fine to leave it here.
Colin slowly lowers himself into a folding chair and lights a cigarette. He looks broken here, as low as we have seen him.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
Kathleen walks up to the house. Jon is outside.
JON
He’s in the barn.
KATHLEEN
Hi, Jon. Nice to see you, too.
JON
Hello, Kathleen. He’s in the barn.
KATHLEEN
Heard they brought the bike back.
JON
Yeah...
KATHLEEN
Where is it?
JON
Why?
She’s maybe the only person on the Isle who isn’t intimidated by Jon. She just looks at him until he breaks.
JON (CONT’D)
Second shed on the right.
INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS
The destroyed bike looks like a big-game trophy not yet mounted. Grass still stuck in the wheels, gouges from the pavement, instrument cluster hanging down like a broken neck.
Kathleen GRABS A SCREWDRIVER off the bench and inserts it into the suspension adjuster on the fork tube. She turns it counting the audible CLICKS. She does the same for the shock. Her movements are efficient and sure. She knows her shit.
Jon walks in, not surprised to see her holding a tool.
JON
You check the settings?
She nods.
And?
JON KATHLEEN
Way off. Short-circuit set-up. Super stiff.
JON
Apparently, he was well-quick back when he was racing in the States.
KATHLEEN
That’s almost worse. False sense of security.
(beat)
You gonna help him?
JON
I don’t want to have anything to do with it. Why don’t you?
KATHLEEN
No way. I’m not doing this again.
COLIN (O.C.)
What are you two doing?
Colin hobbles in. Kathleen discreetly places the tool back.
KATHLEEN
Looking at this machine that almost killed you.
COLIN
Amazing I walked away from it, huh?
KATHLEEN
You didn’t, though. Remember?
Kathleen walks out.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATER
Jon, Peter and their wives and a few of their GROWN CHILDREN are all getting into a packed car. Everyone crowds around Colin except Jon who busies himself with loading the car.
PETER
You know where the antibiotics are?
COLIN
Shed on the north side of the barn.
BRIDGET
And you have our number in Ballymoney if you need us.
PETER
Back in two days. You need anything, just call.
The family drives off leaving Colin to himself.
EXT. FIELD - DAY
Colin is out in the field with the dog, herding sheep from one field to another. His whistles are getting better and the dog and he are starting to communicate. He stops, kneels down and puts his four-fingered hand in the soil.
EXT. KATHLEEN’S HOUSE - DAY
Kathleen leads Colin, using a cane now, to the garage. He has a blindfold on. A brand new BICYCLE sits in the drive. Her mother and the COP from earlier, Fender, are there as well.
KATHLEEN
(pulling blindfold) Okay! You can look. Happy Birthday!!
Colin sees Fender before he sees the bicycle.
COLIN
What’s he doing here?
KATHLEEN
That’s my uncle.
COLIN
You’re kidding me. That’s your Uncle Bob?
KATHLEEN
What? No. Uncle Kevin. What are you talking about?
FENDER
Happy Birthday, mate. Still need to stay on your side of the road, though.
MEREDITH
Look at your present already!
He’s not happy. He tries to put a good face on it.
COLIN
It’s beautiful. Thank you...
KATHLEEN
(annoyed)
What? You can’t explore your environment on a push-bike?
EXT. FIELD - DAY
Colin pulls a hay-bale off the back of an ATV to feed the cows. He’s in pain but fighting through it. In the distance we see a delivery truck pull up to the house. The driver waves to Colin and points toward the front door.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK
Colin is completely drenched in sweat as he limps up to the house. There, on the front steps are six boxes of bike parts.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
Colin eats his Manx dinner alone. Chicken and potatoes. The boxes outside sit right in his eye-line. He stares at them.
INT. SHED - LATER
Colin hauls the last box of parts in with great effort then sits on a crate and stares at his destroyed bike. Instead of beginning the work he gets up, shuts the light and walks out.
EXT. SHED - CONTINUOUS
Colin, cane in hand, limps back toward the house. It’s dead quiet. Then, a SOUND. He stops, waits to hear it again. And there it is. The unmistakable sound of an animal in pain.
Colin moves as fast as he can.
INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
Colin finds one of the cows in the midst of labor. Her water bag has already come out and she is straining.
INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin careens into the kitchen, grabbing for the phone and dialing the number pinned to the wall.
COLIN
Hi, uh, I’m looking for Jon or Peter McCowley. Yes, I know. It’s an emergency. Find them and tell them to call me! Colin. Colin!!
Colin grabs his iPad off the table and heads back out.
INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER
Colin is rubbing the cow’s head.
COLIN
It’s gonna be okay, Heather. You’re gonna have a beautiful, healthy baby. Just keep pushing.
Colin begins to clean the area she’s in. He rakes away all the old, wet hay and lays down a fresh, dry bed for her, then sits on a wood crate and searches the internet on his iPad.
COLIN
‘During the first stage of labor the cow will become restless and often want to separate from the herd...’ We’re way past that... cervix, vagina and vulva all dilate and cervical mucous plug released...
Colin looks at Heather’s rear and sees a wet nose and a hoof now sticking out.
COLIN (CONT’D)
Okay, I’m gonna say that happened already, too.
(Heather strains)
I hear you, baby. Okay, okay. Second stage. ‘Duration of this stage lasts from a half hour in a cow to two to three hours in a heifer. A heifer should be given no more than one hour after the water bag appears before being checked to see if she needs help.’
Colin gets up and stands near the cow’s face.
COLIN (CONT’D)
Are you a cow or a heifer?
She cries out in pain. Colin jumps up and grabs a few things from around the barn - a large pail of warm water, a bottle of cleaning solution. He washes his hands thoroughly then moves around to Heather’s rear and grabs the calf’s hoof.
He pulls. Hard. Nothing. Heather strains but she can’t get the calf’s shoulders past her hips. She cries out again.
COLIN
God damn-it!! Not you, baby. Not you. Come on. Come on!
Back to the iPad.
COLIN (CONT’D)
Traction... Okay. Here we go. ‘...must be able to see three things before traction is applied.’
(looks and counts)
Head and... two paws. That’s three. Okay... Calving jack usage... Tie a loop above the fetlock with a half- hitch below it.’
Colin grabs the calving jack off the wall. He ties two clumsy knots onto the calf’s hooves, then hoists the whole apparatus onto Heather’s rear haunch where he sees the calf’s tongue is starting to TURN BLUE.
COLIN (CONT’D)
No. No. No.
As soon as Heather goes into another bout of straining Colin begins to RATCHET the lever. The legs of the calf PULL TIGHT but the animal is still stuck. It won’t budge.
COLIN (CONT’D)
Come on, Heather! Push! You gotta help me here. Push!!
Colin continues to ratchet until he hears a dull SNAP. Heather yells out as her calf comes tumbling out, seemingly intact but not breathing. Colin stands there looking at it in silent panic. He grabs for the iPad once more.
COLIN (CONT’D)
‘...place a piece of straw in the nostril of the calf.’
Colin grabs a piece of straw off the floor and sticks it in the calf’s nose, which instantly starts him GASPING for breath. He settles into a nice, healthy rhythm and Colin collapses next to him - both exhausted.
Colin looks up to see Heather is now laying down on her side, barely breathing. He BROKE HER HIP with the jack. He drags the calf over and places him by Heather’s head, who begins to lick her calf clean. Colin then moves him to her udder from which he immediately begins to feed.
The phone begins to ring but Colin just sits there on the floor. He strokes Heather’s head as her breathing becomes fainter. She closes her eyes soon after.
FADE OUT:
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
A taxi drives up with Jon, Peter and their families. They head right for the barn leaving their bags in the driveway.
INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
We follow Jon and Peter through the barn. All the cows have been fed and the stalls cleaned. They find Colin sitting on the floor, newborn calf in his lap sucking from a bottle.
Heather lies dead, a few feet away. Jon goes to inspect her, notices the calving jack. Peter and the other family members surround Colin, who seems catatonic.
COLIN
I tried everything.
JENNIFER
It’s okay.
COLIN
I literally did everything it said to do.
BRIDGET
It happens.
COLIN
What does that even mean? What happens?
PETER
Colin...
COLIN
What? What happens? That you do everything you can and shit still goes south? Because I did.
Everything. He wouldn’t come out. He was dying. What else was I supposed to do?
JENNIFER
Colin. It’s okay.
COLIN
No. I’m actually asking you. Tell me. What else was I supposed to do?
Jennifer kneels down and takes his head to her shoulder. Colin cries deeply, fully.
EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
Colin stands outside looking at a car full of Mel’s friends parked outside. Mel comes out holding a weekend bag in one hand and a snorkel and flippers in the other. She stops and looks at her worried father. She softens for him.
MEL
It’s okay, Dad. I’m okay. It’s all okay.
Colin nods quietly.
COLIN
Will you call me after the dive.
MEL
We’re going on like, 25 of them.
COLIN
Jesus. Then call me at the end of each day. Can you do that?
MEL
Yes.
COLIN
I’m serious.
MEL
I will call. Hey. Try and remember that I’m your kid. Means I got mad skills. Get on board.
COLIN
I don’t know what that means.
MEL
Yeah, you do. You were listening to Young Thug on Spotify last week.
For some reason you like pretending you’re older/less cool than you are. I know you’re just trying to be a good dad and all. And you are. But come on...
Colin mulls this over for a moment, then...
COLIN
How did you know what I was listening to Young Thug?
MEL
It’s on your public playlist.
She runs to the car and jumps in.
COLIN
Don’t forget to call me!
MEL
Go ride your motorcycle. It’ll make you feel better.
COLIN
What? What motorcycle? What are you talking about?
Colin is the worst liar on earth. Ever. She laughs at him.
MEL
Bye, Pops. I love you.
They drive off.
INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
Half asleep, walking to the bathroom, Colin trips on the still brand-new bicycle leaning against the wall. He kicks it to the ground with his one good foot and continues onto the bathroom. He then stops and turns back to look at it.
EXT. COLIN'S APT - DAWN
Colin walks outside with the bike. He looks clumsy with it.
EXT. ROAD - LATER
Colin is on the bicycle, working hard when he’s overtaken by four sport-bikes. The wind blast moves him over a few feet.
INT. PUB - LATER
Colin walks in with his modern bicycle gear - spandex, clip- on shoes - and orders a tea. A table of farmers stare at him.
EXT. ROAD - LATER
It’s POURING now. Colin is fighting up a hill and fading badly. Head down, he’s pushing. But it’s too much. He finally dismounts and begins to limp home, leaning on the bike for support, clip-on shoes just audible over the downpour.
EXT. COLIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
It’s completely dark outside now. Colin looks beat as he walks down the steps with the bike on his shoulder.
INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Colin sits in the tub, shivering.
EXT. FARM - EVENING
Jon walks alone toward the shed.
INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS
Colin’s inside battling with the handle-bars on his bike.
JON
You can push and shove all you like.
(MORE)
JON (cont'd)
Those clip-ons are the wrong size. That’s why they won’t fit round the fork tubes. You need to machine the clamp, take some material off.
Colin looks up at Jon for a moment, then goes right back to trying to fit the square peg in the round hole.
JON
Come with me.
EXT. FARM - CONTINUOUS
The pair walk toward an old, dilapidated structure. Jon pulls out a key ring and searches through them. Been a while.
INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS
Inside is a well-equipped machine shop. You’d never know. Colin looks surprised by its existence.
JON
Let’s have that piece, then.
INT. SHED - LATER
Colin sits on a stool watching Jon set up.
JON
You’ve never worked a lathe?
COLIN
No. Let me guess. You got one for your 3rd birthday and machined a set of billet triple clamps for Mike Hailwood in ‘61.
Jon takes a paternal tone we have not yet heard from the man.
JON
Colin. Do you know the reason Heather died?
COLIN
(quietly)
It was a legitimate manual from Colorado State’s veterinary school. Had it on my iPad right in front of me. I did everything it said, word for word.
JON
I’m sure you did. But that iPad can’t teach you how to match the ratcheting to the contractions. It can’t teach you how to feel when the tension on the line is too great. You learn these things by doing them. Come here.
Jon positions Colin at the lathe and makes him do the work.
JON
Take some material off the inside of the clamp. Do it evenly. Slowly.
Colin begins to run the machine.
JON
Used to be most people in your country and mine lived on farms. There was no one to call if something broke. You put your hands on it until it worked again. That’s how we won the war. If you knew how to weld a plow you could rivet an airplane wing. If you worked on a tractor motor you could figure out a radial aircraft engine. Now, what do people know? Apps? Video games? There’s no craft. No feel for things. Joey wasn’t an IT guy in the off-season. He was a farmer.
While Jon moves to a small sink to wash up, Colin returns some of the tools then opens a door into another room.
JON
Don’t go in there...
Too late. Colin already sees it. A COVERED MOTORCYCLE. He looks back at Jon who relents by simply nodding. Colin pulls the dusty sheet off to reveal a beautiful MV Augusta race- bike from the mid-60’s. Jon’s name written on the corner of the windscreen. Colin looks dumbstruck.
INT. KITCHEN - LATER
Jon makes tea for Colin and himself. He does it right.
COLIN
I should have known. The tea business was a dead giveaway. Only racers are that specifically annoying.
He brings the tea over to the table.
COLIN
So what, you just never thought to tell me about it?
JON
Not much to tell. Couple of top-20 finishes. Enjoyed me-self.
COLIN
Did you know Joey?
JON
Yeah. Not me best mate but we knew each other by name. Shared a pint.
COLIN
You had a beer with Joey Dunlop... You ever race with him?
JON
I was on the same course as him but I don’t think it would be fair to say we raced. Joey didn’t race with anyone but the Mountain. Not that she didn’t get her licks in, too.
Took his finger. You share that.
COLIN
Why’d you stop?
JON
Saw one too many friends lose their lives. I knew Kathleen’s dad, you know. We were close.
Stops Colin in his tracks.
COLIN
Kathleen’s dad was a racer?
JON
Yeah. Fast bloke. Podium’d a few times. She didn’t mention it?
Colin is processing.
JON
Whole family lived it for years. Kathleen would come to every practice session. She’d be up at dawn with everyone just to walk the bike through scrutineering. Then Chris passed and... that was that.
COLIN
How?
JON
Outside of Ballacraine. He hit the wall. They all gave it up after that. I did, too.
INT. RAMSEY POOL - DAY
Colin and Kathleen are standing on line at the cafeteria. There is an indoor public pool behind them. “We Built This City” plays on the PA system. They both seem entirely unhappy with each other. Neither smile or even make eye contact.
KATHLEEN
(to server)
Can I have the steak-kidney pie?
COLIN
Same, please.
INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS
They sit at a long table eating with people all around them. No one says anything for an uncomfortable amount of time.
KATHLEEN
Bridget told me you’ve been working on the bike day and night.
COLIN
Yeah, so?
KATHLEEN
Not sure what you’re all pissed off about. You’re the one going off and trying to kill yourself.
COLIN
You’re amazing. You got some nerve asking me not to race. Lying to me this whole time.
KATHLEEN
I’ve never lied to you.
COLIN
But you left out some really big parts.
KATHLEEN
You got something to say, boy?
COLIN
Yeah. I’m really very sorry about your Dad but I’m not him.
Kathleen looks rattled but it only lasts a moment.
KATHLEEN
No, you’re not. You’re alive. But yes, my father was a racer. And yes, I don’t want you to end up like him. Dead. Crazy, I know.
She picks up her things and walks out.
EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
Colin hobbles out chasing after her.
COLIN
Kat! Wait!! Wait one second!
She turns as he hobbles toward her. He tries to find the words. Can’t. They just stand there in the grey drizzle.
KATHLEEN
Why didn’t you tell me?
COLIN
What?
KATHLEEN
Melissa. Why didn’t you tell me?
The color drains from his face. Thinks hard before answering.
COLIN
Because I didn’t want you to know I have nothing to lose.
This lands with her. Breaks her heart, in fact. She’s still hurt but has no more anger for him. She’s just exhausted. She gets in her car but Colin just stands there. She rolls down her window, waiting for him to say something.
COLIN
You drove me here.
INT. KATHLEEN'S CAR - LATER
They are parked on a cliff, overlooking the Irish Sea.
KATHLEEN
And the mother?
COLIN
Lolo. She was an umbrella girl. (off her look)
Gimme a break. I was 23.
KATHLEEN
Yeah, alright. You get a pass. So, you knocked her up.
COLIN
Second time we ever slept together. I knew we weren’t right for each other. I told her as much. I even asked her to...
KATHLEEN
Terminate?
COLIN
She said no way. Said she was having the baby with or without me.
KATHLEEN
And where were you with your racing at that point?
COLIN
Halfway through the season. 1998.
KATHLEEN
You had a sponsored ride?
COLIN
No. Privateer. I was chasing contingency money on a stock bike. But I was finishing on the podium. Consistently. Even won a few races. Came in 5th in the championship. I got noticed, got a factory ride with Honda. I was on my way.
KATHLEEN
And you couldn’t make it work with her?
COLIN
I tried. I married her. We bought a house in Asheville. But she didn’t want that life. She was a party girl. She didn’t want to be a Mom. I think she may have had the baby just to try and hold onto me.
KATHLEEN
Ya think? Okay, so she’s a shitty Mom. Most of the burden falls on you.
COLIN
All of it. She took off.
KATHLEEN
She left?
COLIN
Yeah. Said she needed to get clean and was going home to stay with her folks in Atlanta. I heard she went to New York. Thing was, I was winning everything that season. I had a real shot. And she just picked up and left us.
KATHLEEN
What about your parents? They couldn’t help raise her?
COLIN
Mom died when I was 15. Dad’s old, in a retirement home. No way he could take care of a baby.
KATHLEEN
So, you raised her alone.
COLIN
I had to. I had no choice.
KATHLEEN
(realizing)
You quit racing for her...
COLIN
(quietly)
I had no choice.
She moves to him. Kisses him deeply. Gets more intense. Clothing starts coming off.
COLIN
Are we ever gonna have sex in a bed?
KATHLEEN
You live in a basement. I live with my Mother. Take your pants off.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK
Colin is in his brand-new Alpinestars racing-leathers. Peter wheels the completed bike out of the shed. You can tell this is not the same bike he was riding earlier. It’s loud now, throaty. It’s a TT-ready Super-bike.
PETER
It’s really best to wait until practice starts next week.
(MORE)
PETER (cont'd)
You got no lights, no signals. It’s completely illegal.
JON
How the hell’s he not gonna take it out? Be sensible, Peter.
Bridget comes out of the farmhouse and heads for the laundry line, fully-loaded with drying clothes. She looks up at the sky. Could go either way. She starts to pull the clothing off. Jon and Peter see this near-disaster and stop it.
Bridget! No!!
JON
PETER
Are you insane?!?
She sighs then turns and heads back to the house. Doesn’t even bat an eye.
BRIDGET
Are we back to this, then?
Jon and Peter look at one another, shrug. Guess so. They hoist Colin onto the machine as he can not do it himself yet. Colin adjusts his gloves, then snicks the bike into gear.
COLIN
Any advice?
JON
Yeah. Mind the turns.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Colin is flying through Kirk Michael - 30MPH zone. Sure enough a COP ON A BIKE pulls out behind him and flips the lights. Colin makes a split-second decision and GASSES IT.
They fly through the countryside. The cop is fast enough to just barely keep him in sight. Colin puts the hammer down through Quarry Bends, finally creating some distance.
EXT. KATHLEEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin rides into Meredith’s driveway and hides the bike behind the house. There is no kick stand on it anymore so he balances it against the wall. Rush job. It TOPPLES OVER as soon as he hobbles away. Windscreen shatters.
COLIN
Son of a...
INT. KATHLEEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin limps into the house through the side door.
COLIN
Meredith? You here?
They meet in the living room. She’s cool in her reception.
MEREDITH
Kathleen’s not here.
COLIN
No, I know.
MEREDITH
So, what then?
COLIN
Oh, I was just in the neighborhood.
MEREDITH
Trying to make points then, are ya? Might think about losing the leathers next time, ya prat.
COLIN
Shit.
Meredith turns and sees a police bike pulling up.
COLIN
I’m not here. Please! I get another ticket and they’ll throw me off the Isle.
MEREDITH
So, this is how I get rid of you, then. Perfect.
COLIN
Meredith...
She opens the door as Colin limps around the corner.
EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
The cop removes his helmet and sure enough, it’s Fender.
MEREDITH
Mike. Nice to see you. What do I owe this visit to?
FENDER
Hello, Love. You seen Colin?
She takes a beat.
MEREDITH
No, can’t say that I have. Why?
FENDER
Just need to talk to him. Thought he might have come this way.
Meredith just shakes her head no. They stand there looking at one another for a moment. Fender decides to leave it.
FENDER
Alright. Well, I’ll see ya Sunday for the BBQ. Kids are excited.
Fender walks away but turns before she can get the door shut.
FENDER
Meredith.
MEREDITH
Yeah?
FENDER
Tell Colin he’s getting into Quarry Bends too early. Needs to turn in a bit later so he can carry more speed through the exit. Get a better drive onto the straight.
He’s losing a lot of time through there.
Fender turns away. She closes the door. Colin steps out.
COLIN
Thank you.
He gets nothing. She leaves him there.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER
Colin is straightening the bent mirror as Kathleen drives up. She gets out and sees the shattered windscreen.
COLIN
That’s not even.. what you think. What happened was...
KATHLEEN
It’s fine. Colin. Listen. About the other day. That was a mistake. I mean, it was great. I loved it, but it was a mistake. I can’t do...
(points at bike)
...this with you. I just can’t.
She starts to walk toward the house.
COLIN
You’re so full of shit.
KATHLEEN
Excuse me?
COLIN (CONT’D)
Just be honest right now, okay? We’re two adults looking back with 20/20 vision. Can you really say that you wish your Dad hadn’t shared that part of his life with you?
KATHLEEN
If it means I get to have him here now? Yeah. I could give a shit about the racing. I’d rather have a boring dad who plays darts then a dead one I can tell stories about. Any day.
COLIN
I don’t believe you.
KATHLEEN
Okay.
COLIN
You loved every second of it.
KATHLEEN
I didn’t say that I didn’t love it!
Meredith peeks her head outside.
MEREDITH
Hey. You guys wanna take this inside? We have neighbors.
They both ignore her.
COLIN
You got to share something with him that very few people ever get to share.
KATHLEEN
And you deprived your daughter of the exact same thing!
COLIN
Which was a huge mistake! I thought it would protect her. It did nothing! I should have shared it all. Every second of it. Let her see that her dad had something he loved aside from her.
Kathleen processes this. Gets quiet.
KATHLEEN
Can’t you see that I just don’t want you hurt?
They stand there for a beat. Kathleen goes into the house.
INT. RONALDSWAY AIRPORT - DAY
It’s a mob scene as the TT begins in a day’s time. Racers, fans, media. One gear bag after another pops out onto the conveyor. Seems everyone is holding a helmet.
EXT. RONALDSWAY AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
Colin stands outside leaning against an old panel-van wearing a plaid, wool coat. Fish walks out holding a large duffel.
FISH
Holy shit! Look at you! You look good. Local. Like the guy on the sardine can.
(bear-hugs him) Smell alright, though.
INT. VAN - LATER
Fish is mesmerized. Same look as Colin had last year.
FISH
I can’t believe I’m actually here. I’m driving on the TT course.
Colin smiles. They enter a unique-looking intersection.
FISH
Union Mills! This is Union Mills!
COLIN
Very good. Now you’re thoroughly familiar with the first 800 feet out of 37 1/2 miles.
Fish looks at his pal.
FISH
Someone said that to you, didn’t they?
What?
COLIN
FISH
Yeah, they did. You’ve been waiting, like, a whole year to say that to someone. It’s cool. I can be that for you.
INT. VAN - LATER
Colin slows as they approach the “fairy bridge.”
COLIN
Hello, fairies. Say hello to the fairies, Fish.
Fish just stares at him. Not sure if it’s a joke until... Colin HITS THE BRAKES.
COLIN
Old tradition here, pal. Bad luck if you don’t say hello.
FISH
You can take me back to the airport right now if you want but I’m not saying hello to any fairies.
Someone behind them HONKS. Colin drives on.
COLIN
God, you’re good. I folded in like a half a second.
EXT. COLIN’S APARTMENT - DUSK
Colin and Fish drink beers on his stoop. It’s quiet.
FISH
What time do we start tomorrow?
COLIN
Dawn.
FISH
Bike’s already there?
COLIN
Jon and Peter are gonna bring it over and meet us at the paddock.
More silence. Fish looks at his friend.
FISH
So, how’s it been? Riding here? You have any moments?
COLIN
You mean besides the one that put me in the hospital for two months?
(beat, thinks)
Actually, yeah. A few others.
Fish laughs out loud - anxiety/excitement/fear cocktail.
FISH
Let me see it.
Colin shows him the stub he has left for a finger. Fish stares for a good long moment.
FISH
You don’t need to go nuts tomorrow. Just get acclimated. They say it takes...
COLIN
...three years to learn the course. Yes. I know. Lookit, Fish. I asked you here to wrench for me, not whisper dire warnings in my ear. I already get plenty of that.
FISH
Oh, you met someone? (no answer)
I was kidding. Who is she?
COLIN
She’s not talking to me right now.
FISH
Oh, good. Same skill-set I see. I’m glad it translates overseas.
EXT. PADDOCK - MORNING
The TT fortnight has begun. Everyone is setting up shop - mechanics to cooks. Colin and Fish walk up to find Jon and Peter drinking coffee at a small breakfast stand along with scores of other racers and mechanics. People notice Jon in a meaningful way. He hasn’t been here in a long time.
COLIN
Morning, fellas. You’re early.
JON
Prepared.
COLIN
Jon, Peter, this is Fish.
You can see the brothers are surprised that Fish is black.
PETER
Heard tons about you. Good to finally meet.
JON
Where are your spanners?
FISH
(to Colin) Spanners?
COLIN
Your tools.
FISH
Colin said I could use yours.
Jon grunts. They immediately don’t like one another.
PETER
We should get the pit set up.
EXT. PIT AREA - CONTINUOUS
A 20x20 piece of grass with a tarp thrown up as cover. Fish and Peter work on the bike while Colin meticulously applies tear-offs to his helmet. He looks nervous, lost, alone.
Jon approaches holding a bright, ORANGE VEST. JON
Newcomer’s vest. Put it on.
COLIN
(covering)
I didn’t know there was a Red Lobster on the Isle.
JON
Every first-timer has to wear one during practice. It’s so everyone else knows who to look out for.
Don’t worry, you get to take it off for the race.
Jon walks off and Colin gets down on one knee next to the humming bike. He whispers something to the bike we can’t hear then stands and tries get on the bike himself. The pain is still too great. The boys hoist him on and rides off toward the gathering group of orange-vested riders.
EXT. GRANDSTAND - CONTINUOUS
We are looking down at the starting grid from above. A CONTROL-RIDER leads a line of orange vests - maybe 20 in all.
EXT. START/FINISH LINE - CONTINUOUS
Colin tightens the Velcro on his gloves as he waits.
CONTROL RIDER
Last thing I’ll say is this. There’s two ways you can leave the Isle. You can leave ecstatic, telling everyone who’ll listen that the TT was the greatest race of your life.
(beat)
Or... you can go home in a box.
The control rider picks up his hand and they take off as one long train, passing volunteers holding LARGE SIGNS - Visor Locked? Helmet Strap? Cold Tires!
Colin tugs at his helmet strap. The last sign has the current track/weather conditions - Damp Patches Throughout.
EXT. COURSE - CONTINUOUS
The control rider moves at a decent clip and it’s quickly clear who did their homework. Colin is about 15 riders back in the group. His lines are clean, thought-out. The rider in front of him looks sloppy. After one lap around, the control rider pulls off into pit lane leaving the newcomers to fend for themselves. Colin immediately begins to move forward.
He passes the rider in front of him with ease heading down Bray Hill, then quickly dispatches the next one coming into Braddan Bridge. The rider charges back, out-braking Colin for the following corner. Only he BRAKES TOO LATE, leans the bike into the corner and loses the front and CRASHES.
Colin picks off one rider after another until he’s got nothing but road in front of him. He sets off searching for the lamp-posts that serve as brake-markers, the cattle-gates that signal turn-in points, the walls that mark apexes.
EXT. MOUNTAIN SECTION - CONTINUOUS
From the air. We watch Colin bond with the Mountain. He quickly outpaces the camera screaming off into the distance.
EXT. HOT PIT - LATER
This is where riders make pit-stops during the race for fuel and tires. Colin rides to his allotted box where Jon, Fish and Peter wait. He pulls in, kills the motor and slowly removes his helmet.
Peter throws the bike up on a rear-stand, Jon adds fuel and Fish begins to install a new rear tire. Even as they work, everyone stares at Colin, waiting...
FISH
So? Are you gonna say something???
This breaks Colin out of his stupor.
COLIN
It’s... beautiful. It’s really beautiful.
Fish looks confused, but Jon smiles. Like a familiar smell in a strange kitchen that takes you back to a moment in your past, so does Colin’s reaction do for Jon.
PETER
Were you pushing?
COLIN
No. Not at all. Can’t imagine my times were competitive at all.
He looks to Jon who holds a clipboard and a stop-watch.
JON
No. Not yet. But you’re the fastest newcomer by a country mile.
COLIN
Am I good to go?
FISH
Unless you want me to make some suspension changes.
COLIN
Not yet.
Colin fires the motor back up and pats the gas-tank.
COLIN
Let’s see what she can do first.
EXT. KIRK MICHAEL - CONTINUOUS
Colin approaches Ballacrye, the place where he had his massive crash. He lets off the throttle for just a moment and three other bikes come past him like he’s standing still.
Colin pushes to catch the train of Superbikes ahead of him. Entering a fast but bumpy section right before the town of Kirk Michael, he turns the bike into a corner going a bit too fast and instantly LOSES THE FRONT END.
We see this in SLO-MO as the front tire skips laterally across the pavement instead of rolling forward. But Colin SAVES IT, grinding his knee-puck into the ground, he alleviates the pressure on the tire until it regains traction. He throws a hand up, then pulls off the racing line and slows considerably, confidence shot.
EXT. HOT PIT - LATER
The guys all wait for him.
JON
There he is.
Colin pulls the bike into the pit box and just sits there on the bike, shaking. He’s scared and that just makes him angry.
FISH
(running up) You okay?
COLIN
Lost the front near Ginger Hall. Saved it on my knee. This close.
FISH
Well, let’s make some changes. Were you trail-braking or was it mid- corner?
Colin just sits there. Doesn’t answer.
FISH
Col.
COLIN
Yeah. Just gimme a sec.
He thinks for a moment than stands back up.
COLIN
Just top off the tank.
FISH
You just said you had a moment. Let’s make some set-up changes.
COLIN
No. Fuel it up. I’m going back out.
Fish just stands there. Has no idea what to do.
COLIN
(goes for can)
Okay, I’ll do it myself.
FISH
Okay! Okay!
Fish nods to Peter who begins to fuel the bike. Peter finishes fueling and slaps the gas cap closed.
JON
Listen to me, lad. It’s just the first day. No need to...
Colin revs the motor and goes, cutting him off mid-sentence.
EXT. TT COURSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin exits the pits and immediately slots in behind another faster rider as they scream down Bray Hill. Colin looks stiff. He grits his teeth as they navigate the dip at the bottom. This is a flat-out, 170mph corner.
The other rider gets through okay. Colin’s rear shock BOTTOMS OUT in the depression and the rear wheel comes OFF THE GROUND as he runs out of suspension travel. When the tire reconnects with the ground it goes into a series of oscillations that almost throw Colin off the bike - at 160mph.
Once under control he SLAMS the gas tank with his left fist. His fear translates directly into his riding. You can see it. He looks stiff, lacking fluidity. A race-bike is like a horse
- it knows if you’re afraid.
We see a SHORT MONTAGE of Colin making mistake after mistake.
INT. PUB - AFTERNOON
Kathleen and Meredith are drinking pints in a packed pub. They are surrounded by TT fans.
TT FAN
I think this is the last session.
TT FAN 2
No, there’s still Superstock practice before the roads open.
TT FAN
I don’t think so. You have the program?
Kathleen can’t take it anymore. She answers to shut them up more than to help.
KATHLEEN
Superbike practice finishes in 12 minutes.
(MORE)
KATHLEEN (cont'd) Then there will be a 30 minute Supersport session, then roads open. Superstock is tomorrow morning at 11:00.
TT FAN
Thanks.
Kat turns back to her mother.
KATHLEEN
I just don’t understand how you can say that. After what happened to Dad? And anyway, I thought you were against him racing?
MEREDITH
I was. Until you fell in love with him. You’re a half-wit for doing that.
KATHLEEN
Wasn’t exactly a decision, Mum.
MEREDITH
So, you are in love with him?
KATHLEEN
God damn-it. Yes.
A drunk local approaches. He doesn’t even get a word out.
MEREDITH (CONT’D)
Sod off, Charlie. (back to Kat)
Look, he’s doing this either way now. With or without your support.
KATHLEEN
I can’t believe you’re telling me this.
MEREDITH
At the end of the day a man who doesn’t follow his dreams is not a man you want to be with.
(long beat...)
Not to mention he’d quietly blame you the rest of his life.
Another bar patron comes up to them, this one considerably less drunk. MIKE, a regular, early 60’s.
KATHLEEN
Hey, Mike.
MIKE
Heard your friend had a real moment today.
KATHLEEN
What happened?
MIKE
He lost the front at Barregarrow. Saved it on his knee, apparently.
The look on her face says it all. Caring is not a choice for her to make any longer. She looks to her mother once more.
MEREDITH
When you choose a man, you choose his story.
EXT. HOT PIT - LATER
The boys are all waiting for him. They look anxious. Jon checks the stop-watch.
JON
Should have been back by now.
Colin finally appears by pit-in but instead of going to his crew, he pulls off and heads back to the paddock without even a sign. The boys grab their tools and quickly follow.
EXT. PADDOCK - MOMENTS LATER
Colin pulls in, throws the bike up on the rear stand by himself, takes off his helmet and SLAMS it on the ground. The boys come running up.
FISH
What happened?
COLIN
Everything. Rear shock keeps running out of travel - levered itself off the ground three times. Had a nasty tank-slapper coming into Kirk Michael. Front end was shaking like a dog trying to shit a peach pit!
FISH
Alright. We’ll make some changes.
COLIN
Listen, Fish... we can’t experiment with set-up here.
(MORE)
COLIN (cont'd)
It’s too god-damn dangerous to find out what doesn’t work, and we only have a few more practice sessions assuming the weather holds.
FISH
We’re not experimenting. We’re doing what we always did. You ride, you give me feedback, I make changes.
COLIN
Well it feels like we’re walking around in the dark right now!
FISH
Col. We’re working off a base set- up I got from a good mechanic that Jon knows. I’m not saying the bike is perfect but we’re not playing pin the tail either.
(beat)
What are you doing right now? You know the drill. We work toward the set-up. You wasted two laps by charging out without giving me any feedback or letting me touch the bike. Let’s make some changes and get you back out there.
Colin looks to Jon.
JON
You need to find someone who knows road circuits. When I was racing...
FISH
No offense, Jon, but when you were racing, inverted forks hadn’t been invented. You don’t know squat about setting up a modern litre- bike.
JON
What do you know? You just got off the bloody ferry five minutes ago...!
PETER
Guys! Cut it out!
Colin grabs his bag and walks away.
EXT. PADDOCK - NIGHT
Camera moves past the many racers eating, drinking and telling stories. We end at Colin’s pit-area, which we expect to find dark for the night. It’s not. A work-light is on.
Kathleen, wearing her hospital scrubs, squats next to Colin’s bike, working on the rear suspension. She’s not happy.
VOICE (O.S.)
Kathy?
Kathleen looks up to see an Irishman in his early 70’s with a beer in his hand - BILLY.
KATHLEEN
Hey, Billy.
BILLY
My god. You look exactly the same, love.
KATHLEEN
Thanks.
BILLY
Didn’t think I’d see you working on a bike again.
KATHLEEN
Me neither. Hey, Billy, how much do you weigh?
EXT. PADDOCK - CONTINUOUS
Billy is now sitting on the bike wearing Colin’s racing-suit. Kathleen is taking measurements of the suspension. She has a small pad and pencil and makes notes as she goes along.
KATHLEEN
BILLY
(disciplinary) Kathy.
Sorry.
KATHLEEN
(she starts to move him) Alright, off you go.
She then measures again with him off.
BILLY
What about the shock?
KATHLEEN
Set up for Silverstone. They had the rebound off by a mile.
Compression was fuc... wrong, too.
After each adjustment she stands up and shoves down hard on the forks to see how they behave. Billy just watches.
BILLY
How’s your mother?
EXT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - DAWN
Fish sits on the stoop drinking a cup of coffee when Kathleen drives up and gets out. Fish stands to greet her.
KATHLEEN
Morning. You must be Fish.
FISH
Kathleen?
KATHLEEN
Yes.
We notice a good scrape on the back of her outstretched hand. Fish foregoes the handshake and just pulls her into a hug.
She immediately likes him.
FISH
How are you even awake?
KATHLEEN
I worked a night shift. I’m just headed home.
FISH
Thanks for taking care of him. He’s had a hell of a year.
KATHLEEN
Yeah. He has. Where is he?
FISH
Inside. Taking a shower.
KATHLEEN
How is he?
Fish shrugs.
Right.
KATHLEEN (CONT’D)
INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Kathleen pours herself a cup of coffee as Colin walks out of the bathroom. He’s dressed but his hair is FULL OF SHAMPOO he forgot to rinse from the shower. He’s surprised to see her.
COLIN
Hey... Hi.
KATHLEEN COLIN
(sees scrape on her hand) What happened?
KATHLEEN
Oh, I was just doing some gardening yesterday.
COLIN
You should put something on that.
KATHLEEN
I’m okay. Thank you.
COLIN
So, what’s up?
KATHLEEN
I just wanted to check in and see how you were. Heard you had a rough day yesterday.
He can barely look at her.
COLIN
Nah, not really. I’m good. Ready to get back out there.
KATHLEEN
Yeah?
COLIN
Yeah. Just don’t have a lot of time to talk. Gotta get moving.
KATHLEEN
You sure you’re okay?
COLIN
Yes! I‘m sure! Jesus... Between you and Fish.
Kathleen points at her own head. Colin touches his, coming away with a handful of shampoo. He walks back into the bathroom to rinse it out.
EXT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER
Kathleen sits on the stoop. Colin comes out, sits down.
KATHLEEN
You don’t have to nail your colors to the mast here, you know. It’s not like it is with these other lads, where they got nothing else they can do. You have a career, a skill-set. You have a life outside this place.
COLIN
You think that’s why they race? Because they got nothing else they can do? Come on. You know better.
KATHLEEN
I’ll tell you what I know. I know your head isn’t in it. And I know that’s how you get hurt here.
Colin starts to spin out from here forward. Kathleen stays perfectly calm, straight through.
COLIN
Yeah? Okay. You know me so well, then tell me, where’s my head?
KATHLEEN
I have no idea. You’re a vault. I just know what a TT racer looks like the morning of practice, and it’s not this.
COLIN
And what does a TT racer look like the morning of practice?
KATHLEEN
Excited. Joyful.
COLIN
Uh-huh. And how do I look?
KATHLEEN
You look scared and angry.
COLIN
What am I supposed to do with that?
Kathleen puts her hand on his shoulder. He recoils from her touch, stands, raises his voice.
COLIN
I gave all this up for my kid 20 years ago. Why do you think I’m here? Back at it? Because this is what Mel would have wanted. She knew better than me. She went after it. She got a hold of it. She tried to show me, but I was too scared to see. I shut her down. Over and over.
KATHLEEN
She sounds lovely. I’m sorry I won’t ever get to meet her. But Colin, you couldn’t bring yourself to tell me she was gone. You couldn’t say it out loud. It’s been two years now. Have you ever said the words, ‘My daughter died?’
Colin is silent.
KATHLEEN
I’m not trying to be cruel. I’m not. I’m just trying to help you make peace with this. Because you haven’t. You even lied to me. You told me she was still in North Carolina.
COLIN
She is. She’s still there. It’s where we buried her.
KATHLEEN
Oh my god, you poor man. You are breaking my heart. Colin. Look at me. Hey...
He finally looks up at her.
KATHLEEN
I came here this morning to tell you I’ll get behind you if you want me to. I’ll do that for you. And not in that “do what you want but really I hate you for it” bullshit way. I am stunned by my own scars. I’m terrified at how much I love you. But I’ll only be risking my heart, not my life. If you’re gonna do this, you need to do the same.
You have to give yourself over to this thing that you love. Not in memory of someone else. Mel doesn’t give a shit if you race in her name. She just wants you to be happy. If that means racing, fine.
(MORE)
KATHLEEN (cont'd)
But don’t sit here and tell me it’s what she would have wanted. Tell me it’s what you want! You can’t run the TT angry and in pain. That won’t work. You’ll kill yourself.
You have to love it. I’m not saying don’t race. I’m saying don’t race like this.
Colin looks at her. It’s really something to be known. He nods at her. She’s right. He knows it.
KATHLEEN
I just want you to have that same look me Dad had when he came in after a fast lap.
She heads back to her car, stops before getting in.
KATHLEEN
You’re the most exhausting man I have ever met. I’m going to bed. I have to sleep. Please don’t die this morning. I’d like to see you later and get properly shagged if possible.
INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Colin walks into the kitchen in a daze and sits down at the table under the Joey poster. Fish is in the bathroom singing We Built This City pretty much at the top of his lungs.
Colin pours himself a black coffee and drinks it.
FADE OUT.
EXT. PADDOCK - MORNING
Colin kneels next to his bike, going through his ritual.
JON
What is that?
FISH
You talk to your fairies. He talks to his bike.
JON
Right. I guess so. (beat)
You know you’re my first black friend?
This is as close to an apology as the man is capable.
FISH
I didn’t realize we were friends.
JON
Yeah, well, we are.
FISH
Cool. Cool.
EXT. GRID - CONTINUOUS
Colin is sitting on his bike. They’re in queue, waiting for morning practice to begin. Jon stands next to him.
JON
Go easy first lap. They’re calling for damp patches all through Glen Helen and Sarah’s cottage out to the 11th milestone.
Colin doesn’t respond. He’s swaying back and forth with his eyes closed, riding the course in his mind.
EXT. START/FINISH LINE - MOMENTS LATER
The starter watches the last pair of riders disappear over the rise down to Bray Hill. He signals Colin and the other rider and the pair scream off the line together.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Colin tip-toes through a few corners bringing the tires up to temp. He lets the other rider lead for a bit. Then, something happens. Colin begins to pick up the pace. He dispatches the rider in front of him and disappears into the distance.
CLOSE ON: Colin’s face inside the helmet. He’s smiling.
EXT. PIT LANE - LATER
Fish, Jon and Peter wait for Colin to come in. He flies right past them without slowing for pit-in.
PETER
Guess he’s not coming in.
Jon and Fish hit their respective stopwatches. Both smile.
FISH
Just dropped 28 seconds from his best lap.
Everyone stops at this.
PETER
From a standing start!! What’s he gonna do on a flying lap?!?
JON
About bloody time.
EXT. PADDOCK - LATER
Colin pulls into the pits and starts yelling before the bike is even stopped. They can’t hear him because he hasn’t even bothered to flip up his visor.
JON
Take off your lid, mate!
Colin yanks his helmet off.
COLIN
Yes. Just yes. All of it.
He grabs Fish, hugs him. Fish is beaming.
COLIN (CONT’D)
It’s a whole different bike, Fish. Whatever you did, it worked.
Fish kneels down next to the bike and checks the settings a bit more closely. He looks a little lost as he begins to examine the bike. This is not how he left it yesterday.
Kathleen rolls up. Colin is beyond excited to see her. He grabs her and picks her up.
COLIN
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
KATHLEEN
Okay, okay. Put me down. Now, what?
PETER
Colin notices Fish near the bike.
COLIN
What are you doing? Don’t touch the bike! It’s perfect. Get away from it. Don’t even go near it.
FISH
I’m just marking it so we’ll have the settings recorded. Relax.
COLIN
Copyright em, ya bald bear!!
Fish looks at Kathleen. He knows, and she knows he knows.
INT. VILLA MARINA THEATER - NIGHT
The theater is packed with fans and racers alike. The most famous racers come on stage and play games in front of the crowd. It’s a vaudeville variety show. Colin sits next to Kathleen at a table along with Meredith, Fender, Fish, Jon, Peter, and their wives. They are a racing family once more.
INT. BASEMENT - DAY
A teenage girl, JESS, rummages through some cardboard boxes.
JESS
Oh my god. He kept all of your baby clothes, and the boxes are actually organized by age. 2 to 4, 5 to 8... It’d almost be creepy if he weren’t so hot.
Mel, across the room foraging on her own, looks up. She looks younger here than the last time we saw her, 15 or so.
MEL
Ewwww.
Mel finds another box, buried deep in the back of the basement. Unlike every other box down here, it isn’t labeled. It’s sealed shut but she opens it, anyway. VHS tapes.
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
Mel, alone now, is connecting an old VHS player to the TV. She inserts a videotape into the antique and sits on the floor to watch.
An old Vidal Sassoon commercial plays. Mel presses the fast- forward button until she sees bikes racing around a track.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Well, it was a wild start here at Mid-Ohio. Mixed conditions kept the teams guessing all weekend but the sun came out for the Superbike race today and boy, did we get a show.
Colin McMillan started on the third row but worked his way through the field. It all came down to the last lap and he and Miguel Duhamel went at it!
(MORE)
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)
Four passes in one lap with McMillan making a very brave move into the last corner and taking the win. With three rounds left, McMillan is now up to fourth in the championship. Incredible results from a privateer.
The footage moves to the podium celebrations where Colin holds a 3-yr-old Mel in one hand and a trophy in the other. Mel looks at her Dad with a wonder that only daughters look at fathers with. It doesn’t exist anywhere else.
Mel freezes the frame here and just stares.
EXT. PADDOCK - MORNING
Colin is getting ready. Everyone is there, Kathleen included.
JON
Last day of practice. We race tomorrow. You’re already in a really good position so don’t push.
KATHLEEN
If the race results were based on yesterday’s times, you’d have finished 19th. Newcomers don’t break into the top-40. Doesn’t happen.
FISH
So, go easy today.
PETER
Steady, mate. Steady does it.
Colin watches his people grab tools and gear as they head off toward the grid. It’s a lot to feel this supported and we see him overwhelmed with emotion. He motions to Jon.
COLIN
Hang back a second. I wanna have a word. I just need to tell you...
I’m just really...
Jon sees the emotion and it’s way too much for him. The Manx don’t do feelings. He gets out as fast as he can.
JON
Oh, Jesus. Let’s just get on with it. It’s not a BBC2 program.
Jon starts pushing the bike toward the grid.
JON (CONT’D)
Bloody Americans. Probably wants a cuddle now.
Colin just smiles and follows the man with his bike.
HARD CUT:
EXT. COURSE - MORNING
Colin is riding like a man possessed. He is simply flying.
EXT. GRANDSTAND - CONTINUOUS
Colin tears by the timing tower completing his first lap.
EXT. PIT AREA - CONTINUOUS
Peter and Fish watch him go by in a flash. Fish clicks the chronograph in his hand and just stares down at the number.
FISH
You’re not gonna...
INT. MANX RADIO TOWER - CONTINUOUS
ANNOUNCER #1
...believe this but newcomer Colin McMillan just put in a blistering 129MPH lap.
ANNOUNCER #2
That moves the American up into the top 10 for Super-bike practice.
ANNOUNCER #1
EXT. PIT LANE - CONTINUOUS
Jon walks up as Fish and Peter are just shy of jumping up and down like a couple of school girls.
JON
What now?
EXT. COURSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin flies across Braddan Bridge headed for Union Mills.
EXT. CHURCH - DAY
This one sits right on the course. A large group watch the racing from the front yard. There is a lull in the action and it goes quiet momentarily. A small BLACK CAT crosses into the road as we hear the sound of a bike getting louder and louder. The cat HESITATES in the middle of the road.
EXT. COLIN’S POV - CONTINUOUS
Colin comes flying around the corner and tries to steer around it. But the cat darts forward and Colin hits it square on. HE LOSES THE FRONT OF THE BIKE IN AN INSTANT. No one
could have saved it. He’s ON THE GROUND... SLIDING.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Colin’s sliding toward a bus stop as his bike hurtles toward a stone wall right next to it. The bike hits first and SNAPS IN HALF.
Colin hits the padded side of the bus stop but jumps up and tumbles himself over the low stone wall to avoid getting hit by another bike. Track marshals stand in the road vigorously waving yellow flags.
COLIN’S POV: Blue sky and a large steeple directly overhead. His POV turns to the side and there on the calf of a large man is a TATOO OF JOEY DUNLOP’S FACE.
EXT. CHURCH YARD - CONTINUOUS
Everyone has gathered around and is just staring at Colin. He sits up slowly and looks at the tatoo, then up at its owner.
TATOO MAN
You alright, then?
COLIN
Yeah. Think so. Nice ink.
Relief. They all surround him offering well wishes and tea and biscuits. He’s one of them now. Racing for racing’s sake.
EXT. PIT LANE - CONTINUOUS
Kathleen walks up to find a worried looking Jon, Fish and Peter. She can smell something’s wrong from a mile away.
KATHLEEN
What is it? What happened?
PETER
He should have been around by now.
KATHLEEN
Come on.
They run across to a small office opposite pit lane. There is a computer screen in the window that gives the status of every rider on the course.
CLOSE ON: Computer screen- COLIN MCMILLAN - RETIRED.
INT. RACE DIRECTION OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Kathleen runs inside. There, TWO WOMEN work the walkies.
WOMAN
Which rider?
The other woman recognizes Kathleen and is obviosuly surprised to see her here.
KATHLEEN
Colin McMillan. #37
The 1st woman looks down at the sheet in front of her.
WOMAN #2
Hey, Kat.
KATHLEEN
Shelly.
WOMAN
He’s crashed.
KATHLEEN
Condition?
WOMAN
Haven’t received word yet.
Kathleen sprints out.
INT. PUB - LATER
Colin, pint in hand, is hanging with the locals when Kathleen runs in with Fish, Peter and Jon in tow. She stops dead in her tracks when she sees him. It’s impossible to describe the look on her face because it is too many things at once. She walks straight up to him and SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.
Then, before he can say anything, she KISSES HIM with all the passion she would normally reserve for their bed.
The locals have a reaction. INT. RACER’S TENT - LATER
We find Colin and company in a corner. They are surrounded by many of the other racers. JOHN MCGUINESS, the previous year’s TT winner, approaches. If you met him on the street you’d never know he’s one of the fastest men on earth. He’s still wearing his leathers which instead of his name across the back say “Mc” and then the image of a PINT OF GUINNESS.
MCGUINESS
Hey, Jon. Peter.
JON
How are ya, mate?
MCGUINESS
Good. Good.
(to Colin)
Yeah, just wanted to say hello. You went good today.
COLIN
Thanks.
MCGUINESS
Not too banged up?
COLIN
No. I’m okay.
MCGUINESS
Lucky it was just a cat.
COLIN
Yeah, a horse would have been a lot worse.
MCGUINESS
Heard about that, did ya? And the bike?
JON
Binned it. Frame broke right in half.
Fish arrives with beers, sees McGuiness, stops in his tracks.
FISH
Holy shit. John McGuiness.
Everyone looks at him.
FISH
Did I not just use my inside voice?
EXT. COLOURS - LATER
Closest thing the Isle has to a night club. It’s packed. Everyone surrounds Colin. They’re all in really good spirits considering what happened.
JENNIFER
Fastest newcomer? Are you bloody joking me? You believe this?
KATHLEEN 129MPH lap.
BRIDGET
What about tomorrow?
JON
Bike’s done.
FISH
If it were a pair of clip-ons or an exhaust can... but who brings an extra frame?
A drunk man approaches Colin. His girlfriend is trying to pull him away. It’s the SAME GIRL Colin kissed a year ago in the pub, and the same boyfriend. Colin visibly tenses up as the man approaches. The man throws his arm around Colin like they’ve been friends forever. What a difference a year makes.
DRUNK MAN
Colin. You’re fookin mad!! First year qualifying top 10!!
The guy’s girlfriend sees that this is actually going okay and relaxes a bit.
GIRLFRIEND
(semi-flirty) Hi, Colin.
And just like that, boyfriend snaps and PUNCHES Colin in the face, laying him out. Pandemonium as Fish jumps on the guy, pummeling him. The girlfriend jumps on Fish and now Kathleen is yanking her off Fish by her hair. Fun.
INT. COLOURS - LATER
Everyone is full-on. Colin, tissue in his nose, dances with Kathleen. Fish, Bridget and Jennifer dance with them as well. Jon and Peter stand to the side and sip their pints.
EXT. ROAD - MORNING
We hear the announcers on Manx Radio as we move through the streets and villages of the waking Island.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
Good morning everyone. This is Manx Radio TT broadcasting on this, the 110th running of the TT.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
Looks beautiful out there, if a bit nippy still.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
Weather does indeed look good for the 11:00 Super-bike race. John McGuiness looking very sharp, indeed.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
Definitely the favorite here today.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
The question everyone is asking is will he be the first man to break the 134MPH lap?
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
I think he will.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
Yes, but what do you know? You haven’t thrown a leg over a motorbike in 30 years.
EXT. BARREGARROW FARMHOUSE - MORNING
Kathleen and Colin drive up to the farmhouse that Colin visited a year earlier.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Colin walks in to find the same group of women as he did last year. He buys a couple of sandwiches and teas.
OLD WOMAN
That’s, let’s see, two sandwiches, tea, umm four quid and thirty pence.
He hands over the right amount of money. A few guys recognize Colin and a handful pat him on the back.
EXT. BARREGARROW - LATER
Colin and Kathleen are sitting on the berm watching the end of the sidecar race. They eat their sandwiches and drink their tea. Colin has a small radio tuned to Manx radio.
ANNOUNCER #1 (O.S.)
And Dave Molenxauy is back to winning form after that terrible crash a few years back, taking the side-car race here today.
ANNOUNCER #2 (O.S.)
One hour to the start of the Super- bike race and... I’ve just been handed a note. If Colin McMillan can hear this or someone near him can, he needs to get to the paddock immediately. Says they’ve a bike for him to run.
ANNOUNCER #1 (O.S.)
Well, Colin, you’d better get a move on.
Colin and Kathleen look at one another.
KATHLEEN
Whatever you want, love.
COLIN
(shrugs his shoulders)
I mean I’m here, right? Might as well.
Kathleen bursts out laughing.
COLIN
(out loud)
Does anyone have a bike I can borrow?
Everyone in the vicinity has been eavesdropping and YELL OUT when he asks this question.
EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUOUS
Colin and Kathleen stand in front of a classic 1950’s Honda. A middle-aged man is holding the keys out to him.
Colin hops on. Kathleen moves toward the bike as well.
COLIN
Whoa! Whoa! Where you going? You don’t ride pinion, remember?
(MORE)
COLIN (cont'd)
Wait here and I’ll come back and get you after the race.
KATHLEEN
Get bent.
She grabs the spare helmet and gets on. Colin rides down the short road to the course. A MARSHAL stops him.
MARSHAL
Road’s closed for the race, sir.
BYSTANDER
(screaming)
It’s Colin McMillan! He’s racing! Let him go!
CROWD
Let him pass!!!
MARSHAL
Didn’t recognize you under the lid there, Colin. Good luck.
KATHLEEN
Will you just ride slowly, please?
He tears off wheelying the bike for a good 100 feet, Kathleen slapping his helmet as he goes.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
They are the only two people on the road as it is completely closed down for the start of the race. They pass the thousands of spectators lining the roadside.
EXT. PADDOCK - LATER
Fish greets them as soon as they ride through the gate.
COLIN
What did you do?
FISH
Wasn’t me.
Colin turns his palms up. Who, then?
FISH
McGuiness.
COLIN
No way.
FISH
Yes way. Factory frame, plus some extra bits. Trick shit, dude.
Unobtanium, sign an NDA type shit.
EXT. COLIN’S PIT AREA - LATER
Colin’s pit-area currently resembles a bedouin flea market. People are coming and going carrying parts and tools. Racers we’ve never met bring parts and help assemble the bike.
Fish, Jon and DAVE HAGAN, Colin’s engine builder are placing the original motor into the new chassis. Colin is transfixed. John McGuiness walks up.
MCGUINESS
You were going too bloody well. I hope you don’t mind.
COLIN
Thank you.
MCGUINESS
Alright, well, tell Jon to stop drooling on the frame and put the bloody motor in it.
JON
Sod off, McGuiness.
Laughs. They’re excited and nervous. And running out of time.
COLIN
The engine was okay, Dave?
DAVE
Just case-covers which Bobby threw in. Internally, it was mint.
Colin looks confused and overwhelmed.
FISH
Go get changed. Race starts in 10 minutes.
COLIN
Who’s Bobby?
A RACER we’ve never seen with his suit halfway around his waist stands up, shakes Colin’s hand.
BOBBY
No worries, mate. Good luck!
COLIN
Thank you. Whose forks are those?
JON
Tuxworth owed me one. Ohlins. Full Super-bike spec.
Another fully-suited racer we’ve never met runs up with a new exhaust. He drops it at Fish’s feet. He has a pack of cigarettes taped to his chest protector under the suit.
RACER
Gotta run. Good luck, Colin.
PETER
Go get changed.
COLIN
What about the set-up? I need you to dial those same settings in, Fish.
FISH
Yeah, about that. Look, Colin...
Kathleen senses the impending confession and cuts him off.
KATHLEEN
For Christ’s sake, babe. Go get changed! He’ll get it right for ya.
He just stands there. In shock.
JON
You’re starting to piss me off, lad.
He finally leaves. Though not without looking back. Twice.
KATHLEEN
(to Fish)
You’re his mechanic. He trusts you. He needs to know that it’s you.
Fish nods. They both converge on the machine.
FISH
Plus, if he knew it was your set-up he might ask you to marry him.
KATHLEEN
Yeah, definitely don’t tell him, then. How’d you know, by the way?
FISH
Cut on the back of your knuckle.
KATHLEEN
You didn’t buy the gardening story?
FISH
I actually found it insulting.
KATHLEEN
(laughing)
Hand me the 5mm Allen.
EXT. GRANDSTAND - CONTINUOUS
The sell-out crowd sits in the Spring sun.
EXT. PARC FIRME - CONTINUOUS
This is the pre-staging area right next to the start/finish line. It’s basically a huge parking lot where all 80-odd bikes and their riders/teams wait for the call to the grid.
Kathleen, Fish, Jon and Peter are all standing around the now- completed bike which is sitting with tire-warmers on. Colin walks through the gate and stops short when he sees it.
COLIN
What do you think?
FISH
I’m not crazy about the wheel color.
JON
Nor I. Let’s not do this.
PETER
Best not.
Jon, Fish and Peter begin to walk away. Kathleen bursts out laughing. One of the officials walks through with a sign that reads 2 Minutes. With this, every bike starts its engine. 80 bikes with open pipes. You feel it as much as you hear it.
FISH
We’re gonna go get the pit-box ready.
COLIN
Yeah, go ahead.
They all hug Colin. One after the other. Slowly and meaningfully. Kathleen kisses him on the lips.
KATHLEEN
Have fun.
She means it. He knows it. It’s a fucking gift.
EXT. GRID - CONTINUOUS
Every rider is now lined up waiting for their turn. No more pairings. Every rider is alone now. The opponent is the Mountain, not the man in front or behind. Fastest time wins. Doesn’t matter if you start first or last.
Jon and Colin begin the slow walk to the starting line. Jon pushes the bike along. Riders are let off in 10-second intervals. They look like a line of gladiators waiting their turn to enter the coliseum.
JON
How you feeling, lad?
COLIN
Little nervous. Haven’t turned a single lap on this thing.
JON
You were bloody quick yesterday and this is just your old lady with new clothes on.
COLIN
I never figured out Ballacrye. Still lift every time I go through. Not sure about Kate’s Cottage, either. I’m on the racing line but then I can’t see the entrance to the next corner until it’s right...
Jon puts his hand on Colin’s arm.
JON
It’s time to let it go, Colin. You’ve done all you can to prepare.
Colin calms and listens.
JON (CONT’D)
You know which way the road’s going now. Close the book and just ride.
EXT. PIT AREA - CONTINUOUS
Peter and Fish prepare the pit-area as Kathleen organizes the tool box and affixes the tear-offs to the spare helmet. They are scrambling to get ready for Colin’s first pit-stop.
EXT. GRID - LATER
Colin now has three bikes in line in front of him. He kneels down at this point and whispers to his machine.
Jon helps him get on the bike, pats him on the back and leaves. One more rider in front of him. Colin inches up to the start/finish line. He closes his shield and feels the starter’s hand rest on his shoulder. It’s FUCKING HEAVY. Colin has the 1,000-yard-stare working now.
He REVS THE PISS out of the bike holding the clutch in, and waits. The starter looks at his watch. The hand comes off and Colin drops the clutch. The bike SPUTTERS and almost STALLS!
EXT. PIT AREA - CONTINUOUS
Colin’s crew watches him at the line.
FISH
Slip the clutch!!
PETER
What happened??!!?
FISH
He’s never done a race start on the thing.
EXT. COURSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin gets the bike going and once he does, none of it matters. The bike hits its power-band and the front wheel comes right off the ground as he screams toward Bray Hill.
EXT. COURSE - CONTINUOUS
Colin is riding carefully. He sets up every corner perfectly but there is a stiffness that was not there yesterday. He passes the section of road where his accident occurred a day earlier. He can’t help but have a quick look in both directions as he comes around the corner.
No cats.
EXT. CHURCH YARD - CONTINUOUS
The crowd erupts as he comes through. They’re with him. Manx Radio comes through on a loudspeaker in the church yard.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
Colin McMillan has just come through the first timing split. He is down 18 seconds on the leader putting him in 26th place.
ANNOUNCER #2
Bit disappointing. What with the times he posted earlier this week we all expected him to do the business.
ANNOUNCER #1
It’s early still. And the man’s coming off a massive get-off only yesterday. You always been this pessimistic?
ANNOUNCER #2
It’s me wife I think.
EXT. BALLACRYE - CONTINUOUS
Colin approaches the high-speed jump. The riders in front of him take to the air. Colin LETS OFF the throttle at the last moment. The issue is the loss of momentum. That one second off-throttle costs him hundreds of yards down the next straight. Riders who did not let off come by him. Momentum.
EXT. MOUNTAIN SECTION - CONTINUOUS
Colin comes off the pace when he sees a marshal frantically waving a yellow flag. Around the next corner lies a downed bike. The rider is nowhere to be seen. It’s a rattling sight.
EXT. PIT LANE - CONTINUOUS
Colin’s crew sit on the wall waiting for him. Colin screams by and they all pump their fists and cheer him on. Fish holds his timing board out for him.
JON
(looking at stopwatch) He’s way off yesterday’s pace.
EXT. MOUNTAIN SECTION - CONTINUOUS
Colin is overtaken by the rider behind him at Windy Corner and still another one coming into Kate’s Cottage. The road suddenly seems narrow and the camera shows us the edge of the track and the steep drop-off for the first time.
EXT. GOVERNOR’S BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Colin comes in way too hot to this extremely slow corner. Rookie mistake at the TT. He LOSES THE FRONT but saves it on his knee. The crowd GASPS as he picks it back up.
EXT. PIT LANE - CONTINUOUS
Colin comes flying in and they attack the bike. Fuel goes in and, rear tire is changed, helmet and wind-screen cleaned. A scrutineer walks around the bike checking to make sure it’s continually track-worthy.
FISH
What is it? Is something wrong with the bike?
COLIN
No. It’s fine. Times off?
JON
COLIN
I don’t know.
FISH
Just want to make sure it’s not the bike.
COLIN
It’s not the bike!
Kathleen leans in close. Her mouth is almost inside his helmet. No one else can hear her.
KATHLEEN
You love this, remember? More than anything. Like Joey did. Like me Dad. Let go and love it.
Colin stares at her. She’s right.
Peter gives the clear sign as the wheel is tightened. They start the bike, Colin revs it, drops the clutch and STALLS!! Colin hits the starter button. Nothing. Fish and Jon start pushing the bike down pit-lane to jump-start him. It works.
FISH
(screaming)
Flywheel, asshole!! Slip the god- damned clutch!!!
Colin starts LAUGHING inside his helmet. He slips the clutch perfectly and screams down pit-lane and onto the course.
JON
Was he just having a laugh?
FISH
(annoyed) Yeah.
KATHLEEN
I’m gonna say, good sign.
EXT. BRAY HILL - CONTINUOUS
The Colin from yesterday begins to peek out. He screams down the hill without lifting the throttle. The crowd sees. They have a big reaction - mouths open, hands on heads.
ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT:
We now ride on-board with Colin looking directly out the front of the bike. This is done in real time. No CGI. Buildings blur with trees, people and walls. Speed.
EXT. PIT LANE - CONTINUOUS
The crew sits and waits for Colin. They listen to Manx Radio which is being played through large speakers.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
Colin McMillan finally showing signs of life.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
Here he comes in for his second pit stop. And... he just turned a 130MPH lap!
The crew crane their necks to see where he is. The siren goes off and here’s Colin.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
Incredible. Fastest lap ever for a newcomer, obliterating Peter Hickman’s 2014 lap.
Colin comes flying down pit-lane. Fish moves out into the road so Colin can see him. He’s taped an AMERICAN FLAG to his chest. Colin guides the bike into the pit, cuts the engine and... THE SOUND GOES OUT. ALL OF IT. NOTHING BUT HIS BREATH.
The crew work feverishly on the bike and while they’re all talking to Colin, he hears nothing. Kathleen pulls his face shield. Jon cleans the windscreen. Fish muscles the rear wheel off. But for all this racket we hear only Colin’s even, measured breath. Kathleen gets the new face-shield on and as soon as she slaps the visor down...
THE SOUND COMES CRASHING BACK.
JON
...especially through Ramsey. Made a ton of time up! You got two more laps. No more pit-stops.
Colin hasn’t heard a word.
The impact-driver hammers the rear axle-nut home and Peter pulls the rear-stand, dropping the bike back onto the ground. Engine starts and Colin’s off. Clutch no longer an issue.
EXT. BRAY HILL - CONTINUOUS
Colin is now a man on a mission. We’ve never seen him this loose, this committed. He comes down Bray Hill so fast that the belly-pan of his bike bottoms out and sparks off the pavement at 170mph. The bike goes into a CRAZY WOBBLE but he just accelerates harder to quell it. No big deal.
EXT. QUARTER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Colin backs it into this sharp, right corner while passing someone. It’s a hairy, short-track move. He makes it stick.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
I’m gonna go ahead and say I’ve never seen anyone back it into Quarter Bridge while simultaneously overtaking.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
No words for that. Need a minute.
EXT. BALLACRYE - CONTINUOUS
Colin approaches the jump once more. Two riders in front of him take to the air. This is the jump he always lets off on. The jump that put him in the hospital.
CLOSE ON: Colin’s throttle hand twists the grip to its stop. COLIN HITS THE JUMP FLAT OUT. We see this in EXTREME SLOW-MO.
The wheels spinning, the bike sailing through the air at 140 MPH. Colin keeps it straight and lands it perfectly screaming away down the following straight.
EXT. MOUNTAIN SECTION - CONTINUOUS
Knee down on every corner, Colin might as well be on a Grand Prix circuit. He’s passing people everywhere. He runs the bike out to the LAST INCH of pavement on one exit. Close.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
Wow! That was inches from disaster. Inches.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
This is real short-circuit stuff here from McMillan.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
Might need a knicker-change after that one.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
You or McMillan.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
Can only speak for me-self.
INT. MANX RADIO - CONTINUOUS
Inside the studio we are with our two announcers.
ANNOUNCER #1
Colin McMillan has somehow found his way into 12th place with one lap to go.
ANNOUNCER #2
Found his way? It’s a bloody forced entry.
ANNOUNCER #1
He’s coming through the start/ finish line right now. Waiting for a time...
EXT. START/FINISH LINE - CONTINUOUS
Colin screams past the pits as his entire crew leans over the pit wall screaming their heads off. Fish is holding a pit- board over the wall that says: -16 Hutchy.
INT. MANX RADIO - CONTINUOUS
The announcer looks at the screen in utter shock.
ANNOUNCER #2
Well? Let’s have it, then.
ANNOUNCER #1
I don’t want to misreport this but it looks like Colin McMillan just broke the lap record.
ANNOUNCER #2
For a newcomer.
No.
ANNOUNCER #1
They both cover their mics so the listeners can’t hear them.
ANNOUNCER #2
That must be a mistake. What speed?
ANNOUNCER #1
The two men look at one another. They take a moment. They compose themselves and go back to work. Professionals.
EXT. COURSE - CONTINUOUS
We cut to a few different locations where spectators are gathered and we listen to the news with them.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
Well folks, never a dull moment on the Mountain. It seems we are reporting history here at the TT. Colin McMillan has in fact broken the all-time lap-record here with a blistering 134.1 MPH lap.
And the crowds go crazy!!
ANNOUNCER #1
McGuiness is not going to be happy with that.
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)
I imagine not, being that he supplied him the bike to do it with.
ANNOUNCER #1
Quite a ride for the American in this, his first year on the Isle.
ANNOUNCER #2
Irish-American.
ANNOUNCER #1
(happy to get on board) Yes! Quite. The Irish-American Colin McMillan on a flying lap.
EXT. PIT AREA - CONTINUOUS
One of the factory teams is currently trying to find the right letters to spell McMillan for their rider’s pit board.
They had all of the usual suspects name’s prepared - McGuiness, Anstey, Dunlop, Hutchy. All useless right now.
CREW
(to no one in particular)
...because we don’t have one with bloody McMillan written on it!!
EXT. MOUNTAIN SECTION - CONTINUOUS
We see Colin from a helicopter. It’s quiet and surreal from up here. They’re moving the same speed.
INT. ANNOUNCER’S TOWER - CONTINUOUS
ANNOUNCER #1
Colin McMillan is on his way to what looks like a top-10 finish here at his first visit to the Isle.
ANNOUNCER #2
Certainly doing the business now.
ANNOUNCER #1
Man on a mission.
ANNOUNCER #2
Martin is well ahead on the road but only 12 seconds ahead on the clock. You can be sure they’re giving him the hurry-up sign.
EXT. UNION MILLS - CONTINUOUS
Colin races toward his own apartment. There in the distance is what looks like a man standing in the middle of the road. He’s doing 180MPH so it comes up fast.
It’s the image of himself from that first morning when he felt the bike coming toward him at sunrise.
Colin motors right through his own ghost and turns the throttle to its stop.
EXT. BALAUGH BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Colin sails over the small jump but on landing the right foot- peg SNAPS CLEANLY OFF. Colin’s foot comes off the bike and hits the ground. It throws him and he slows dramatically looking down to see what’s happened. He quickly finds a spot for his heel on the swing-arm of the bike.
EXT. BALLACRAINE - CONTINUOUS
The crowds wait for Colin to appear. Everyone is caught up in the drama of his last lap.
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
Whoa!! It seems Colin McMillan has lost a foot-peg!
Colin comes flying by a moment later. The crowd goes absolutely wild. His foot is angled out from the swing-arm but he has picked his pace right back up.
EXT. GRANDSTAND - CONTINUOUS
The big-screen shows the replay of his peg snapping off.
KATHLEEN
For Christ’s sake. Can we get a break here?
JON
Be tough to ride like that. No question. He won’t be able to stand for the bumpier sections now.
EXT. PIT LANE - CONTINUOUS
John McGuiness passes the start/finish and slows for the U- turn that takes him back toward the podium. The people that line the narrow path all reach out to slap him on the back, but many other are craning to look at the jumbotron. Even John stops to watch on his idling bike.
INT. ANNOUNCER’S TOWER - CONTINUOUS
The two announcers are looking at the times on-screen.
ANNOUNCER #1
Well, this is a first. Have you ever seen this?
ANNOUNCER #2
Can’t say that I have. Always know the finishing order by this point. McGuiness will take the win with Hutchinson looking sufficiently ahead for a strong second. But third is too close to call at the moment.
ANNOUNCER #1
Colin McMillan turning things on their head this week at the TT.
ANNOUNCER #2
Well, we’ll all just have to wait and see what Mr. McMillan can pull out of his hat this last half-lap. A podium finish is theoretically still possible.
EXT. BALLACRYE - CONTINUOUS
Colin flies over the jump again. No hesitation at all. We see it at speed this time and it’s breathtaking. His foot comes off the peg on the landing, however, and we see it TWIST BACK grotesquely.
Close on: Colin’s face contorted in pain.
INT. ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH - CONTINUOUS
ANNOUNCER #1
I think something happened on that landing. He’s slowed up.
They watch the landing in slow-motion and see the leg twist.
ANNOUNCER #2
My god.
ANNOUNCER #1
Had to have torn something. He should not be continuing on.
EXT. MILNTOWN - CONTINUOUS
Colin’s going through one of the bumpier parts of the course heading into Ramsey. He can’t stand up and so he absorbs every bump right on his ass. He’s being tossed around like a rag-doll. Once he emerges into Parliament Square the crowd goes bananas.
EXT. PODIUM - CONTINUOUS
The race-officials have placed the bikes of McGuiness and Hutchinson in their respective podium positions - 1st and 2nd. But the 3rd spot is left open.
EXT. MOUNTAIN SECTION - CONTINUOUS
Colin, now on the smooth pavement of the Mountain section is no longer bucking about, but must now deal with the fact that he can’t stabilize himself on the right turns. He bends the bike into one of the faster rights only to have his FOOT COME OFF THE SWING-ARM.
His boot hits the ground and just barely misses being run over by the rear wheel. He yanks it up and jams it back into the swing-arm. He’s on the edge of traction on every corner. He’s spinning the rear up on every exit. He passes Joey’s statue where everyone is now on their feet.
EXT. GOVERNOR’S BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Last corner. Colin slows for the sharp right and then motors down the final straightaway.
EXT. GRANDSTAND - CONTINUOUS
Colin screams past the finish line. Every single person watches the board and waits to hear the announcers call the time. It goes strangely quiet.
INT. ANNOUNCER’S TOWER - CONTINUOUS
They both look at the timing screen waiting for the total elapsed time to show. And then there it is.
ANNOUNCER #1
(calmly) He’s done it.
EXT. GRANDSTAND - CONTINUOUS
The place erupts. Colin slows for the U-turn and gets the same treatment as McGuiness on the ride up toward the paddock. Only people are climbing over the fence. This is history. The crew meets him halfway. He still doesn’t know...
He almost drops the bike as he collapses off of it. Fish steadies the bike as Peter and Jon prop him up between them. There’s blood coming out of his suit by his boot. Colin notices everyone cheering.
COLIN
What is it? Did I break the top- 10???
No.
FISH
COLIN
What, then?
JON
You made the bloody podium! Third!!
Colin can’t believe it. He just can’t. He fumbles to get the helmet off and is absolutely mobbed by everyone. Fans, racers, friends. Kathleen kisses him.
EXT. PODIUM - CONTINUOUS
Colin stands up on the box next to McGuiness and Hutchinson, trophy in hand. McGuiness has to hold him up. The entire paddock and grandstands are on their feet cheering for Colin.
This is the moment you wait a lifetime for. Right now.
FADE OUT.
EXT. FARM - NIGHT
Colin, no longer limping, walks toward one of the barns with a beer in hand. The kitchen door opens and Jon comes out after him. He looks SLIGHTLY NERVOUS.
JON
Where you going, lad?
COLIN
Just wanted to check on my cow. That alright?
A light on inside Colin’s work-shed pulls him away from the barn. He approaches the door with curiosity, even a bit of caution.
INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS
Colin walks in to find Kathleen working on his bike. He stands there in total shock.
COLIN
What are you doing here?
She looks at him like he’s as stupid as he sounds.
KATHLEEN
I’m ironing your shirts. Give me that beer, please.
He hands it to her, scrambling, trying to put it all together.
COLIN
I don’t understand. The whole time? You were doing this all along?
KATHLEEN
Hand me the 8mm and get out of my light.
He does, then sits down next to her and watches her wrench. Stares with a mix of awe and love. Like a Labrador puppy.
KATHLEEN
Oh, Christ. Fish said this would happen.
