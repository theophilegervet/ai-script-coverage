GOIN’ HARD
FADE IN:
INT. RANCH HOUSE - EVENING
A raucous wedding party in the sprawling living room: DRUNKS stumble about; WAITERS pass out more booze. Cowboy HATS with tuxedos. WOMEN and GIRLS who’d look sexier in jeans wearing Neiman-Marcus gowns.
Amidst the chaos: One island of seeming tranquility is occupied by the bride and groom, MEGAN (25) and BOBBY (late 20s). She glowers at BUSTER (20s). Buster’s opened jacket exposes a Glock at his waist.
BUSTER
(to Bobby)
Shit, Bro! That’s better’n a ounce of blow!
Bobby grins at Buster, then winks at his wife, who glares at both.
Then Megan turns, winks and smiles at Buster, flutters her eyelids.
BUSTER
Hot damn! Wait till I tell Mix an’ Hardy!
Megan kisses Bobby’s cheek, slides a hand under his baby blue tux jacket ... then snatches a .357 magnum revolver from his cummerbund. She thumbs the HAMMER as she raises the weapon ... blasts a round into the FLESH under Bobby’s chin.
Silence ... then screams. BLOOD, BRAIN and BONE rain on Megan and Buster as Bobby’s carcus hits the floor. She casually points the gun at Buster’s chest ... and waits ... wipes a blood droplet from the end of her nose.
The room empties.
MEGAN
What now, Buster? You figure Bobby’s permission for you and his asshole buddies to gang-bang me still stands.
Buster shakes his head and ... wets his PANTS.
MEGAN
Get out of here. Now!

EXT. BUS SATION, BEAUMONT, TEXAS - DAY - MONTHS LATER
JUDGE (VO)
Megan Garza, do you have anything to say before this Court passes sentence upon you.
A white van at the curb. A prison GUARD rolls open the side door, and from the interior security cage steps a rail thin ...
FOSTER JOHN (30s)
... Hippie hair. Long beard. Moustache. Gray sweatsuit, Reebok Ruffits. A big black BIBLE in one hand. A clear plastic bag of toiletries in the other.
MEGAN (VO)
I want to invite you and every other pompous ass in this county to share the needle with me.
The guard hands Foster an envelope.
GUARD
Cash, like you requested. Four hunnert an’ ninety dollars from yore account. Fifty bucks from the Bureau of Prisons.
FOSTER
(takes the envelope) Bless you.
GUARD
Don’ matter how fast ‘r how far you c’n run, life catches up. We’ll keep a cell open for you.
FOSTER
Waste of time, friend. Jesus runs in these shoes with me.
INT. BUS - DAY
Foster gazes out the window. Reads Highway signs: LUMBERTON ... JASPER ... CENTER ... CARTHAGE ... MARSHALL ... LONGVIEW ...
TERRELL ... and finally, MESQUITE.
INT. MESQUITE BUS STATION - NIGHT
Foster on a pay phone.

FOSTER
How about I come by tomorrow early. Give you, say, a 200 dollar deposit. Then I’ll have a cashier’s check cut for the remainder within
24 hours.
Foster scans the station while he listens.
FOSTER
(looks up, covers mouthpiece) How great thou art.
(uncovers microphone) See you then.
INT. JAIL - WEE HOURS
The corridor door slowly and silently opens and two deputies tiptoe in. The youngest, SAVAGE, rips down a blanket covering the bars at the front of a cell. CRAFTON, the eldest, shoves a
tripod-mounted security camera out of their way.
In the cell, Megan calmly zips her orange jumpsuit as she rises from the toilet.
MEGAN
Great timing, Savage. Have you been watching the monitor all afternoon? Waiting for me to pee?
SAVAGE
Outside, Garza! Assume the position on the wall.
After Megan obeys, Savage does a feelie-fest shakedown while Crafton ogles her butt.
MEGAN
Satisfied ... asshole?
Savage throws his shoulder into Megan’s back, slams her into the wall.
CRAFTON
Take it easy.
MEGAN
Christ. I hit a nerve? Isn’t that what you do ... bully women?

SERIES OF SHOTS:
1)  Foster pulls his cash from the prison envelope. Stuffs it in a pocket cut from sock and sewn inside his sweatpants.
2)  Foster sleeping on newspapers on a lawn. His Bible, his pillow.
3)  Plastic mirror hung on a tree trunk, Foster brushes his hair
... winks at his image.
4)  Foster and a Motor Home OWNER stand near an old Holiday Rambler. Foster counts out four fifties, passes them to the guy.
5)  Foster counts out four fifty-dollar bills to a huge WOMAN.
INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY
Foster: Bible laid on a stack of boxed softballs. Inspecting gloves. And bats.
A salesperson, GINGER, approaches.
GINGER
Hi, I’m Ginger. May I help you?
FOSTER
I reckon not. I have a tryout tomorrow and wanted a glove and bat, but this stuff is way too expensive for me.
GINGER
Who’re you tryin’ out with?
FOSTER
Trinity Baptist Church over in Oak Cliff.
GINGER
(smiles)
You must really be good.
FOSTER
Fair. No, better than fair.
GINGER
If I had Trinity on the line and my money was short, I’d pay a visit to the pawn shops downtown.
5
EXT. CITY PAWNBROKERS - DAY
Eyes hidden under the bill of a ball cap, Foster exits. Bible in his left hand. Ball bat slung over his right shoulder. A big
black and brown fielder’s glove dangling from the end of the bat.
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY
Seemingly without a care, Foster hums JUST A CLOSER WALK WITH THEE as he ambles along.
He stops in front of a tiny café. Checks his money: Two QUARTERS and a DIME.
INT. CAFÉ - DAY
Foster eyes a sign: COFFEE $.50 NO REFILLS. He mixes creamer and sugar into the brew. Lays the DIME beside the mug before he sips.
EXT. DOWNTOWN ONE-WAY BACKSTREET - DAY
Blue light aflash on the dashboard. Unmarked police car double- parked ... beside an ancient four-door sedan.
BILLY JOE (70s) and SHEILA (60s) on the sidewalk. He sits in a wheelchair, guarded by a spit-shined female cop, HENNING, while Sheila glowers at Henning’s male partner, REEVES.
Reeves writes a citation. Henning stands behind Billy Joe, hand resting on her pistol.
BILLY JOE
Now, lemme git this straight: You’re writin’ Sheila a ticket fer takin’ my wheelchair out on the wrong side of the car?
REEVES
The streetside, Sir. That’s against the law. To say nothing of being dangerous. The traffic—
SHEILA
(interrupts)
Billy Joe, you hush. This ain’t—
BILLY JOE
(to the cop)
There ain’t no traffic, you ass- kissin’, locksteppin’ bonehead! Won’t be till rush hour!
6
Reeves stops writing. Stares through mirrored sunglasses.
REEVES
How would you like to go to jail? Abusive language is against the law.
BILLY JOE
Damned street’s deserted till rush hour!
Foster rounds a corner, forty feet from the cop-citizen confrontation. He raises his gaze to the heavens and smiles.
FOSTER
(whispers)
Thank you, Je-sus! How great Thou art.
Foster’s step suddenly has spring. He saunters by. One step past the female cop, his left hand releases the ...
BIBLE
... And grabs the butt of the softball ... BAT
... Hips and body twist. Full windup. And swing. The fielder’s
... GLOVE
... Sails over the hood of the old sedan. Toward the street. The BIBLE smacks concrete.
The BAT smashes into Henning’s arm ... CRUNCHES the elbow. The GLOVE lands on asphalt.
Foster whirls. Reverses direction. Swings. Bone SNAPS. The BAT smashes the male cop’s gun arm above the elbow.
Sheila gawps: Eyes wide; mouth opened.
Billy Joe spins ... wheels. Retrieves the Bible and backs away.
The female cop opens her mouth. Part SCREAM, part GROAN, but tries for her pistol with her left hand.
Foster aborts a second swing at Reeves as Billy Joe trundles past to pull Sheila out of harm’s way. Instead he, pivots.
7
Smashes the bat into Henning’s left shoulder. She drops the piece. Shock and pain. She passes out.
Bent at the waist, looking between his own legs, Foster swings the bat underhanded—backward and upward ... into the male cop’s
...
CROTCH
... Whoof! Breath explodes. Reeves doubles. Grabs jewels and drops.
Foster jabs the cop on the top of the head with the big end of the bat. Lights out.
Billy Joe and Sheila gape.
Foster nods and smiles to the old woman. Tips his cap.
He grabs pistols and magazines from both cops. Badges. ID folders and wallets. An ankle holster and small pistol from Henning, then her Sam Browne belt and radio.
Bible on his lap, Billy Joe raises his hand ... like a school kid.
BILLY JOE
(grins)
I don’ mean to pry, son, but what’s your battin’ average?
FOSTER
(points up)
Way up there. The Lord helps those who help themselves.
Foster circles the police car and climbs into the driver’s seat.
INT. STOLEN POLICE CAR - DAY
As Foster drives, he removes an M-16 from the rifle rack. Spots a Leatherman tool on the dash. Pockets the Leatherman.
Spots a Dallas Police Department windbreaker and pulls that onto his lap.
He switches on the yelper. Speeds up.
After crossing the Trinity River into Oak Cliff, he pulls in behind a Chrysler 300 and toots the horn.
8
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
Foster bails from the prowl car. M-16 in one hand. Badge in the other.
The Chrysler’s driver steps from his car. Eyes Foster’s badge.
FOSTER
Tanner. Dallas Police! Undercover! I need your car. Following a suspect. Take mine to the downtown station.
DRIVER
You can’t—
FOSTER
(interrupts)
Come on, man! You wanna citizenship award? A spot on the Six O’Clock News.
Yes, Sir!
DRIVER
INT. BANK - DAY
Foster: Police windbreaker, Henning’s radio SQUAWKING from his waist, mask fashioned from a sweatshirt sleeve. The rest of the shirt turned into a bag. He points to the prettiest of the TELLERS.
FOSTER
When I leave, you come with me. Dye bombs go off, or transceivers, your brain explodes.
He points to his radio.
FOSTER
I’m listenin’ to the police.
He tosses the pretty teller his sweatshirt bag.
FOSTER
You do not want me to hear about this robbery over the radio.
EXT. STREET - SAME
9
FOSTER (VO)
Bag up the money. Fast. Don’t forget the head teller’s drawer.
Twenty police cars and a swarm of OFFICERS surround the stolen police car.
The Chrysler’s DRIVER comes out with hands in the air.
DRIVER
There must be some mistake. I didn’t do any—
DETECTIVES roughly throw him to the ground and cuff him.
DRIVER
I didn’t do any—
One detective kicks him in his side.
INT. BANK - DAY
POLICE RADIO VOICE
10-4, Dispatch. We need CS techs. (background voice)
Yeah! We got the son of a bitch!
Foster nods to the MANAGER and HEAD TELLER.
FOSTER
Money safe. Now! Use your jacket as a bag. I want the cashier’s checks and the embosser.
The prettiest teller starts to rake currency into Foster’s bag. Halts. Turns. Glares at a young male TELLER behind her. Then she scoops bills, leaving a ...
BLOCK
... Of twenties on the counter.
EXT. MALL PARKING LOT ENTRANCE - DAY
Foster steers onto the lot.
After the Chrysler disappears amongst other vehicles, four police CRUISERS whizz by. Yelpers SCREECHING.
Seconds later, Foster exits, driving an old Ford pickup truck.
10
INT. FORD PICKUP - DAY
Foster: Parked. Cashier’s check embosser on the seat, he leisurely cuts two checks.
MONTAGE - FOSTER’S ESCAPE

—   Foster hands the beaming motor home owner a cashier’s check.
—   In a garage, Foster sets aside a pair of Wilson .45's from a workbench. Next, he grabs a Heckler & Koch 91 and a Springfield M1A. Hands the big woman a cashier’s check.

WOMAN (VO)
You cops and yore guns! My husband wus the same damn way. Ruther shoot them damn thangs than have sex.
FOSTER (VO)
I can’t imagine why.
—   Foster: Driving at night. Yawning. Fighting to stay awake. Highway signs ... HICO ... LAMPASAS ... MARBLE FALLS.
BILLY JOE (VO)
I’m tellin’ ya, tha one with tha bat was bigger’n all them fellers.
—   Foster exits a mall. Loaded with shopping bags. Casual, middle class attire. Short hair. Clean shaven. Sunglasses.
—   Foster in a gun shop. Buying holsters, magazines and ammunition.
INT. CAFÉ - EVENING
Foster: Jeans and windbreaker. At the counter. Hunched over a coffee mug and a piece of lemon meringue pie. From his expression, he could be in a five-star restaurant.
A TV hangs in a corner above the counter. Evening News.
11
JAKE’S BUDDY (OS)
Looky there, Jake. That’s tha bitch!
Foster looks over his shoulder.
JAKE and his BUDDY occupy a booth, Jake’s buddy pointing at the silent TV.
JAKE’S BUDDY
Bitch got tha death penalty. Shot Bobby the night they got married.
Foster turns back, slides a well-mannered bite into his mouth. Savors. Watches the TV.
INSERT - TV SCREEN
MEGAN GARZA. Handcuffs. Waist chain. Shackles. Jailhouse orange. A couple of shitkicker DEPUTIES wearing white cowboy hats.
WAITRESS (OS)
Way I heard it, the new husband wus gonna pass her around to ever’body at the weddin’ party.
JAKE’S BUDDY (OS)
Don’t matter. Bitch gits married, she does what she’s told.
BACK TO SCENE
A WAITRESS stops in front of Foster.
WAITRESS
Ignore the dipshits, please. Can I gitcha somethin’ else?
Foster smiles, shakes his head, swallows, then nods at the TV.
FOSTER
Where was that story filmed?
WAITRESS
Over at the county courthouse. Bastards shudda gave her a medal.
Foster glances up.
INSERT - TV SCREEN
His photograph flashes ... then cuts to a REPORTER. Chattering. Holding a microphone out to Sheila.
12
BACK
INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - WEE HOURS
Savage and Crafton in civilian attire: Jeans, boots, western shirts. Cheap western hats on the desk. Savage, scratches his crotch, then his goatee. Watches a closed-circuit monitor.
Crafton uses a Buck knife to scrape dung from his boot.
SAVAGE
(whispers)
Crafton, she hung a sheet over tha bars. We run back now, we’ll ketch ‘er doin’ ‘erself.
CRAFTON
Why you whisperin’? You figger the bitch can hear you?
Crafton starts to rise. Freezes midway up.
Foster stands at the door. Ski mask. Windbreaker pulled back for easy access to the .45 on his right hip. M1A snugged to his shoulder, aimed dead at Crafton.
Foster elevates the barrel. BLASTS two rounds into the ceiling.
Savage springs to his feet, wheels. Looks down the thirty-caliber barrel.
FOSTER
(loud)
Do I have your attention?
Both deputies nod.
FOSTER
Guns on the desks. I find a backup later ... you die. Empty pockets, too. Badges, ID’s. The works.
Savage empties his belt and boot holsters.
FOSTER
The girl who killed her husband. (nods toward JAIL door)
Let’s go! Move!
INT. JAIL - WEE HOURS
The lock on the corridor door CLACKS as the toilet flushes. Savage pushes the camera aside.
13
MEGAN (OS)
You idiots are too slow.
The sheet across the bars drops.
Megan: Orange jumpsuit. Paper slippers.
With Savage standing close, a shaky-handed Crafton unlocks the cell door. Swings it open.
Brainlock: Megan simply stares at Foster.
FOSTER
You can come out, if you want ... but I can’t keep the offer open very long.
Megan sidles through the door, pauses before the young deputy. Grabs his shirt for leverage. Knees him in the balls.
His breath explodes. He grabs his crotch ... bends. Megan gets in his ear ... whispers.
MEGAN
Someday I’ll make time for you. I promise.
She snatches fistfuls of greasy hair. Propels him into the cell’s rear wall. Rubs fingers against her palm. Makes a yucky face.
When she sidles past Crafton, she wipes her oily hands on the front of his shirt.
Crafton backs away. Until Foster’s barrel touches the back of his head.
Inside.
FOSTER
EXT. BACKROAD - WEE HOURS
Megan: Rides sidesaddle on the frame bar of an English bicycle. Foster peddles. Rifle and small pack slung over his shoulders.
MEGAN
Haven’t you ever heard of getaway cars?
14
FOSTER
Police own the roads. The bike doesn’t make noise. Easy to haul off into the weeds when we see lights.
MEGAN
Cold as a frozen hind quarter.
FOSTER
Steer.
Foster shucks the pack and his windbreaker. Stops so she can don the jacket.
MEGAN
Do you have a name?
FOSTER
No. Call me Prester. What’s yours?
MEGAN
(steps away from the bike) Wait a minute. You break me out of jail ... without knowing my name?
FOSTER
(grins)
I do good deeds. But not often. It seemed like the right thing to do
... at the time.
MEGAN
What if I hadn’t wanted to leave?
FOSTER
From what I heard two knuckle- draggers say, what I saw on TV, you didn’t seem crazy. I mean, these people really were going to squirt something lethal into your arm.
MEGAN
Good point. I’m Megan Garza. My friends call me Meg. You qualify.
FOSTER
You know how to shoot?
MEGAN
Likely better than you. I grew up on a ranch. I do most of the stuff the shitheels do.
15
Foster stares at her. Curious.
MEGAN
I shot my first buck when I was eleven. From four hundred yards. And I’ve never owned a scope.
Foster pulls the other .45 from the holster at the small of his back. Hands her the cocked and locked pistol and a spare magazine.
FOSTER
One in the throat.
Megan takes the weapon, but checks the load for herself.
MEGAN
Why?
FOSTER
Let’s just say, for now, that I have an affinity for women who refuse to be passed around to horny cavemen.
MEGAN
What if I don’t develop an affinity for jailbreakers?
FOSTER
I didn’t ask you to. Don’t expect you to.
INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY
Sheriff BOXERLIN: Sunburn red from neck to hatband level, then fish-belly white. Blubber abulge over his shirt collar. Anger: Blood-pressure fault lines. The brink of eruption.
Crafton and Savage sit opposite the Sheriff ... on the edges of seats. Hang-dog. Hats in hand.
SAVAGE
But I didn’t do—
16
BOXERLIN
Hush! ‘Fore I git up from heah an’ stomp a mudhole in yore ass! I got Aaron Carter breathin’ down mah collar, and I ain’t about to lose the next election ‘cause you turdheads was tryin’ to peek at a nekid whore insteada doin’ yore dang jobs!
CRAFTON
Tell us what to do, Sheriff. We’ll do it.
Savage nods.
BOXERLIN
Gall-dang for sure said that right! You’re gonna hunt that tail- twitchin’ bitch down an’ kill her. Somebody else shoots her, you gall- dang sure better be handy to git yore picture took with the body.
That clear?
Crafton shakes his head.
CRAFTON
I cain’t work with him. He’s flaky.
SAVAGE
I went through the same SWAT trainin’ you did. Houston PD and at the Federal Law Enforcement College in Georgia.
BOXERLIN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, certi-fuckin’- fied badasses who let one skinny runt take you down. So pack yore suitcases an’ live in ‘em till you find that bitch!
SAVAGE
What about tha dude? He—
BOXERLIN
(thunders)
He don’t do nuthin’ for mah gall- dang campaign fund, you idiot! I don’t give a shit what you do with ‘im! Now, git yore goat-smellin’ asses outta mah office!
17
INT. MOTOR HOME - DAY
Foster sets supermarket and shopping bags on the table, then backs away and watches while Megan paws through the bags until she finds cigarettes.
She fires a Marlboro.
What?
MEGAN
FOSTER
Just thinking that those jeans never looked that good on me.
MEGAN
Your jeans have never been on you. They’re new. Your Jockey shorts, my size by the way, shirts, socks, all new.
FOSTER
I got some L’Oréal to change your hair. Eyeglasses with plain lenses. Sunglasses. Running shoes.
MEGAN
You’re mighty evasive for somebody who sticks out his neck for people he doesn’t know.
FOSTER
Tonight, we’ll get you across the river.
MEGAN
Great. No money. No ID. How long you think I’d last?
Foster pulls a duffel from under the kitchen bench. Unzips. Megan’s breath catches. Then she sucks nicotine.
FOSTER
Take whatever you need. Whatever you want.
Megan stares at currency. Bundles.
MEGAN
Drugs. You hafta be into drugs.
Foster shakes his head. Grabs one of her Marlboros. Sticks it into his mouth, but doesn’t light up.
18
FOSTER
You should be able to buy an ID in Matamoros.
MEGAN
When was the last time you were in a Mexican border town?
FOSTER
Never been in one.
MEGAN
They’re war zones. I wouldn’t last two hours.
FOSTER
Look, I broke you out on impulse. I’m on a fast track with a real tight schedule. I don’t have time—
MEGAN
(interrupts)
Could be interesting ... especially since there are no signs of alcohol here, or drugs ... or women.
FOSTER
I’m either going to get rich ... or die tryin’. Extremes, Megan. No middle ground.
She snicks a lighter to fire his smoke.
MEGAN
Sounds to me like you need somebody to watch your back.
She stares at him. Steps closer. No come-on. Simple, aggressive anger.
MEGAN
I have nothing to go back to ... nothing to lose.
Foster sucks smoke, gazes into her eyes. Impulse.
FOSTER
My name’s Foster John. Get ready. After dark, we’re going to shop for transportation. Corpus Christi.
19
INT. BAR - DAY
JABBER, a red-headed giant, HACK, BEAR and NATE guzzle beer in a corner booth. BEANIE occupies a chair in the aisle.
JABBER
Money’s hard ta come by, but if one of us could git over tha border an’ score some brown, we could trade it fer meth.
Jabber studies his companions.
BEANIE
(shakes his head)
Ain’t none of us gonna cross that river w’thout gittin’ snatched up comin’ back.
(looks about, whispers) I say we phony up some heroin.
Catch Cisco when he’s alone, an’ trade it to him.
HACK
Beanie’s right. That greaseball’s scared to death of heroin. Ain’t about to test nothin’ hisself.
Jabber wipes at his nose, downs about half a bottle, and listens. Bear speaks up.
BEAR
Hack, you an’ Beanie been sniffin’ glue ag’in? You fuckers fergit how many people that Mes’can’s cut up in the last couple years? He ain’t cuttin’ on this bear ‘cause I ain’t gittin’ crossways with ‘im.
JABBER
Bear, you an’ Nate could cross the river out in tha middle of nowher’. Take Nate’s dirt bike over. Buy about a grand’s worth an’ hustle on back.
Bear looks to Nate.
NATE
And jus’ where do you plan to rustle up a thousand dollars?
20
INT. AMG MERCEDES - DAY
Megan: Dark auburn hair. Short hair. Huge sunglasses. She drives. Foster keeps looking out through the tinted windows.
FOSTER
So, I’m on Day Three Outside. Sleeping when I can. Nine days. If I don’t show in Ciudad Camargo by then, Alcaraz will get to thinking about how much I might know, maybe change his MO.
MEGAN
How much ... money?
FOSTER
Millions. Dope comes north. Cash goes south. Humongous quantities of both. I don’t know where, but I’ve got the name of a man who used to bodyguard Alcaraz. He knows the name of the DEA agent who runs the money south.
MEGAN
(looking to the mirror) Shit! Highway Patrol.
FOSTER
Damnit! What the hell did we do wrong? Buckle down.
Mars lights flash in Megan’s mirror. She pulls to the roadside. Foster watches until the cruiser has almost stopped.
EXT. U.S. HIGHWAY 77, SOUTH - CONTINUOUS
FOSTER (VO)
When I tell you, slam into reverse gear and floor it.
The cruiser stays two car-lengths behind the AMG.
FOSTER (VO)
Now!
No hesitation. The AMG’s rear wheels lay black streaks of smoking rubber. The crash buckles the German machine’s quarter panels.
Stop!
21
FOSTER (VO)
Foster bails out, .45 in hand, he sprints to the driver’s door.
Forehead gashed and bleeding, the COP lies across the seat. Out cold.
Foster races back to the AMG.
EXT. FARM ROAD - DAY
The Mercedes tears down the two-lane blacktop. Past an abandoned farm. A long stack of baled hay. Covered with a plastic tarpaulin. Near the road.
FOSTER (VO)
Stop. Turn around.
EXT. FARM - DAY
AMG parked at the end of the hay stack. Megan and Foster hurriedly stack bales over the car.
Foster pulls the black tarp over the new extension.
MEGAN
I wish we had your rifles. Since we don’t, you better have another good idea or two.
FOSTER
(points)
We’ll hole up down on that creek, then head back to Corpus Christi after dark.
EXT. CREEK BED - EVENING
Foster laces ferns into willow branches, then has Megan sit under the tree while he sprints to higher ground to check his work.
FOSTER
We’re good. They won’t see us from the air.
When Foster crawls under the shelter, Megan sits, legs pulled up, arms folded under her breasts.
22
MEGAN
Is it okay to be scared shitless now?
FOSTER
(smiles)
Yeah. I’ve been scared since I left prison.
Megan stares at him, until tears erupt.
MEGAN
I thought they were going to kill me.
FOSTER
They were. That’s what they do.
Foster scoots around behind her, pulls her back into his arms.
FOSTER
Easy. I’m one of those men who really likes women. I’m not going to hurt you.
Megan leans back. Shuts her eyes.
MEGAN
Tell me. Talk.
FOSTER
I’ve been a thief most of my life. Trying to be slick. Avoid being arrested. But I got arrested anyway, usually for shit that had nothing to do with stealing.
Megan wraps her arms over his.
FOSTER
Last time, I went to prison for assault. I beat up a clod on federal property. Should’ve killed him.
Megan fires a cigarette, passes it back to him.
FOSTER
Think-tank time. I made up my mind that I was goin’ hard. Take what I want, then run to someplace where the people aren’t so soft and timid.
23
MEGAN
Any particular place in mind?
FOSTER
Siberia. The Taiga. People there see cops for what they are. Thugs.
MEGAN
So you’re trying to out thug the thugs?
FOSTER
Yeah. Kinda lame of me ... when you put it that way, but that’s exactly what I’m doing.
Megan fires another cigarette for herself.
FOSTER
So bottom line is this, Megan; save your crying until the job’s done.
Then you can let it all hang out without endangering yourself.
MEGAN
Or you, huh? I—
The sounds of helicopter rotors stifle talk.
SERIES OF SHOTS
1)  EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY: Megan meets Foster as he exits a graphic arts store carrying a big case.
2)  EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY: Foster, still packing the supply case, strolls down a lane with Megan. When they reach law enforcement cars, she begins jotting down U.S. Government license numbers.
3)  EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY: Megan on point while Foster slim jims his way into a white, four-door Ford.
4)  EXT. STREET - DAY: Outside a welder’s shop, Megan leans against a parking meter. Waiting. Watching the door.
5)  EXT. POLICE SUPPLY STORE - DAY: Foster exits to find Megan waiting. He hands her a sack and keeps one.
INT. ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY
Foster grabs his sack, turns from the cashier to leave, but a television catches his attention.
24
INSERT - BOXERLIN ON SCREEN
BOXERLIN
I don’t believe there’s any danger
... locally. Garza and her accomplice are no doubt fleein’ to Mexico.
(shuffles papers)
I want to assure you that no effort will be spared until Megan Garza is back behind bars ... where she belongs.
Telephone numbers appear on screen.
BOXERLIN
I assigned my two best investigators to the case. The phone numbers you see will be staffed 24/7. Deputies takin’ your calls can reach the investigators in seconds.
(lays papers aside) Nobody’s goin’ to rest. Nobody’s goin’ to worry over budget restrictions. None of that stuff. I’ll see Megan Garza back in my jail or die tryin’..
BACK
EXT. CAMPGROUND - DAY
Foster parks the white sedan next to the motor home. He and Megan climb out. She walks around the Ford. Slowly shaking her head all the way.
The Ford sports U.S. Government license plates. A blue emergency light on the dash. Security cage separates the front and the rear seats. Radio antennas.
Megan’s dark blue U.S. Marshals windbreaker is opened in front. Badge on one side of her belt buckle. Cuffs on the other.
MEGAN
I can’t believe we’re doing this.
FOSTER
You don’t want to be hassled in a police state, you become a cop.
25
MEGAN
Cops have beer and pizza guts. We don’t.
FOSTER
Smoke more. They’ll think you have cancer.
MEGAN
What now?
FOSTER
We eat. We get to work.
MEGAN
Beer and pizza?
FOSTER
(grins)
I only drink non-alcoholic beer.
Megan teasingly smirks.
Sissy.
MEGAN
INT. FORD - DAY
Megan drives. Foster looks out: way ahead to the causeway leading to South Padre Island.
FOSTER
Stop. Shit! Go back to the campground.
MEGAN
Why?
FOSTER
We can’t go over there. We catch heat on that island ... we are cooked. No way off.
MEGAN
You know, Foster, I kinda like being proactive ... as opposed to waiting for some clod to do something bad to me.
She turns ... winks at him.
26
MEGAN
So, unless you want to fight, we are crossin’ that bridge.
Silence stretches.
What?
MEGAN
FOSTER
Just wondering why women like you are so hard to meet.
Megan smiles as she steers onto the 101 Causeway.
FOSTER
You gonna go ballistic if I try to seduce you later?
MEGAN
(chuckles)
I’ve been wondering what took you so long, and I may get mad if you don’t. Ballistic is for sex. Jail cells are mighty rough on a girl’s hormones.
Megan checks the traffic behind them. Then she grins at Foster.
MEGAN
SEDUCE? Really? You know how to do that stuff?
FOSTER
Old time romantic. I don’t do HOOKING UP.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
As Foster exits a condo, Megan climbs from the car. Positions the H&K 91 across the front seat. Scans the terrain. Casually, she steps to the rear. Opens the trunk. Checks the M1A on the carpet.
FOSTER
We’re cool. He moved. The marina closest to the causeway in Port Isabel. A houseboat named Floatin’ Turd.
MEGAN
Oh, great. This drugstore cowboy has to be a true winner.
27
EXT. MARINA - DAY
Rusty, decrepit and listing, the houseboat rocks in the water.
Megan stands on the dock, eyeing a toilet tank float imaginative hands turned into a copper flower pot; it holds some kind of cactus and hangs from a chain beside the door.
On the opposite side, a porcelain toilet tank lid with the name “Floatin’ Turd” in brown script.
Noises from inside: Glass SHATTERS; furniture CRASHES. Megan reaches for her pistol. Changes her mind.
INT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY
Copper pot dangling from the right hand, Megan steps inside as
... FOSTER
... Skids across a dirty linoleum floor. Jabber follows.
Megan swings. Misses. Momentum turns her. Too far. She catches a backhand in the back of her head.
Foster springs up. Wheels. Wades in. Collects two gut punches. Folds. Like a wallet.
Tomboy aim and grit. From behind, Megan kicks. Her instep connects.
Breath explodes. Jabber grabs his crotch. Twists toward Megan. She swings again. The ...
POT
... Crashes into the goateed man’s ear. He wilts in his tracks.
Foster groans. He bleeds from his nose and rapidly blinks, plainly trying to defog his brain.
Megan helps him rise to a sitting position.
FOSTER
(agasp)
Hope ... you didn’t ... kill him. I could’ve ... handled him.
28
MEGAN
Sure, you could. Great job ... you were doin’. Look at me.
She slowly waves a finger before his face. Side to side.
MEGAN
You’re okay, but we do a reality check this instant:
(points to Jabber)
He’s about six/five, around three hundred pounds, and on your best day, you won’t handle that much beef.
Jabber groans, starts to rise.
Megan kicks him in the face. Squats. Sits on his chest. Rests the barrel of her .45 right on his moustache ... and drops the SAFETY.
MEGAN
You wanna die?
No verbal answer. Blue eyes go wide.
MEGAN
That’s what I thought. Name?
JABBER
John Morris.
Megan slides the barrel up. Presses the end of his nose.
JABBER
Jabber. Jabber Yoakum.
MEGAN
Well, Jabber Yoakum, my friend has questions. Every time you refuse to answer, I’m gonna shoot you ... some place that isn’t vital, but I promise to ruin a tattoo. Every time.
Megan rises, backs away, then looks to find Foster staring at her
... dumbfounded.
You—
FOSTER
MEGAN
I told you ... I grew up with them. We should’ve bought tasers.
29
FOSTER
(to Jabber)
The DEA agent who delivers the weekly take to Alcaraz ... his name?
Jabber bursts in laughter. He points a finger at Foster. Hoots.
Starts to say something. Howls. Finally, he breaks into a fit of giggles.
Then he snorts and snoggles, swipes at an itchy nose with one hand, then the other ... the spastic motions of a meth head.
JABBER
Been waitin’ on you. Not you in perticular, jus’ somebody comin’ ta take down Alcaraz’s money.
Megan aims at Jabber’s knee.
JABBER
(to Megan)
I’m either in, ‘r you can go on an’ dust my ass now.
He looks to Foster ... calculating ... then back to Megan, and back to Foster ... and suddenly seems sly and smug.
JABBER
Betcha’ll didn’t aim ta kill me, huh? Prob’ly got some place fixed up to hol’ a hostage fer a few weeks.
FOSTER
And, what’s wrong with that?
JABBER
Screamin’, soft-ass amateurs! You got any idea how many people Alcaraz is gonna throw at you?
Mes’c’ns? Border Patrol? DEA? Local Po-lice?
MEGAN
(to Foster)
Bring in the duct tape.
FOSTER
(to Jabber)
Tell me why you’re worth all the trouble.
30
JABBER
I couldn’t proposition any of tha local gunslingers. Somebody mightta talked.
FOSTER
You can do better than that.
JABBER
You gotta kill the DEA honcho ... an’ I got tha perfect place ta dump tha body.
FOSTER
There’s a whole goddamn ocean out there where I can dump a goddamn body. Yours ... for instance.
JABBER
See? That’s how much you know.
MEGAN
Strange boats get stopped goin’ out. Big boats. Little boats. A damned row boat. The federales keep more boats here than the damn Navy.
JABBER
I’m in, ‘r you git nuthin’.
MEGAN
(to Jabber)
You ever been on a ranch during branding season? Or when they cut bull calves? I can make you sing and dance “Tiptoe Through The Tulips” if I decide to. Give you a lisp Liberace would’ve envied.
Jabber cuts his eyes at Foster ... clearly not so sure of himself.
FOSTER
(to Megan)
We might be able to use him.
JABBER
Full partner, ‘r nuthin’. Fifty- fifty.
FOSTER
She gets a third. You get a third.
31
JABBER
Nobody gives a damn bi—
Megan snatches a fistful of scrotum.
JABBER
Yow-ow!
She slaps him across the jaw with her pistol.
His head twists so fast, his mashed ear splatters blood on her shirt.
Jabber looks to Foster. A silent plea.
FOSTER
We have an agreement?
EXT. U.S. HIGHWAY 83 - DAY
The white Ford rolls west.
JABBER (VO)
This sucks! I done ripped out more o’ them s’curity screens than you been in po-lice cars.
MEGAN (VO)
We should’ve bought a big orange jumpsuit. Made this look real. We also need GPS units, in case we get split up.
JABBER (VO)
Nasty-tempered bitch, ain’t ya? I done figgered out who you are.
Didja know Bobby Carter’s daddy posted a hunnert thousand dollar reward f’r your ass?
FOSTER (VO)
You looking to collect, Jabber?
JABBER (VO)
Not me. That reward’s peanuts.
MEGAN (VO)
Bobby was nasty-tempered. Look where it got him. You might benefit by remembering that.
JABBER (VO)
I—
32
MEGAN (VO)
And I don’t do the bitch trip. So save the video-slash-junkie talk for the juveniles.
EXT. FARM ROAD - DAY
A sign: TEXAS FARM ROAD 2098.
EXT. DIRT TRACK, WOODS - DAY
Jabber, Megan and Foster stand on the dirt road. A few feet away, the SAND glistens. Wet. Surface perfectly flat.
Jabber tosses out a flat rock; it plops, then slowly sinks from sight.
MEGAN
I didn’t know there was quicksand in Texas.
FOSTER
On the Red River. Dam any river to create a lake, you increase pressure underground. Water bubbles up. If the surface is sand, you get this.
JABBER
We checked ‘er out once ... nearly a hunnert feet deep.
MEGAN
(to Foster) Where’d you learn that?
JABBER
Jail, prob’ly. He looks like one o’ them readers. Prob’ly scared ta go out on tha yard with tha big boys.
Foster simply sighs.
Megan backs away, palms her .45.
MEGAN
(to Foster)
I really can make this ape talk.... And this is a convenient place to dump the leftovers.
33
FOSTER
We made an agreement.
EXT. MARINA - NIGHT
Foster and Jabber: Foster circles the car, waits as the big man climbs out.
JABBER
See ya in tha—
FOSTER
(barely above a whisper)
You have any thoughts about me and prison, you keep them to yourself.
Jabber looks surprised.
FOSTER
You’re a greasy slob of a citizen who got caught up in crime because he’s weak and wants to get high.
I’m here because this is what I do.
JABBER
You think—
FOSTER
(steps closer)
If I ever point a gun at you, I will pull the trigger. Do your job. We take this money. Three-way split. That’s all. You won’t survive anything else.
Disdainful, Foster recircles the car. Climbs in beside Megan, who stares at Jabber through the windshield.
Open-mouthed, Jabber watches the Ford reverse, then burn rubber. He slips a cell phone from his pocket. Thumbs a number.
INT. FORD - NIGHT
Megan steers to a curb. Nudges the selector into Park. She twists. Faces Foster.
MEGAN
You’ll be around for a while, right?
FOSTER
That’s not up to me.... Like I—
34
She shifts her butt onto the console. Leans over. Pulls him to her. Kisses him long and hard and tightly holds on.
Up for air ... smiles, and leans in for a quick kiss. Then she settles back behind the wheel.
FOSTER
So much for me seducing you.
MEGAN
(grins, sultry) Wanna call this off?
EXT. CAMPGROUND - NIGHT
The Ford’s skid kicks up dust.
Megan and Foster tumble out. Dash to the door. She keys the lock. He opens the door.
INT. MOTOR HOME - CONTINUOUS
Foster pulls Megan inside.
Before the door swings closed, she’s in his arms.
They stumble. Try to tear each other’s clothes free with lips locked. Frantic. She pulls him to the floor.
INT. NATE’S TRAILER - NIGHT
A huge Confederate Flag sags from one living room wall. Other walls hold anti-government posters, deer heads, and stuffed fish and a raccoon skin.
Hack salutes the walls with a long-neck Bud as he dodges clutter. He plops to a sofa, next to a splay-legged Bear.
At the dinette, Jabber hunches over a map. Across the table, Nate picks at the label on his Bud bottle.
Hyper and twitchy, Hack switches on the TV. Nothing.
HACK
(to no one)
This thang busted, ‘r what?
Jabber smooths wrinkles in the map.
NATE
Nah. It ain’t broke.
35
JABBER
This is ever’thang we been talkin’ about since grade school. Score of a lifetime.
Hack whacks the TV with the flat of his right hand. On his forearm, a huge U.S. Navy tattoo.
NATE
About time we git our shot.
Mouth sucking beer bottle, Bear tilts back his trucker cap, then massages his neck.
JABBER
Yer damn right.
BEAR
Hey. If we gonna cross tha river ta score some smack, how’s about gittin’ some seen-yerita tail while we’re at it?
Jabber raps the tables with his knuckles.
JABBER
Goddamn it! You didn’ hear nuthin’ I jis’ said? We ain’t sellin’ no her-o-in. Big dummy.
BEAR
Ain’t no fair callin’ me dummy.
JABBER
You’re right.... Ain’t your fault yer dysfunctional mama fed you tainted milk.
(glowers at all three)
Now, listen: When this skinny weasel is dealin’ with Mes’c’ns an’ cops, we gon’ take his ass down. No muss. No fuss. Him an’ the bitch git the blame. We git tha money.
Hack scowls at the TV. Steps back ...
NATE (OS)
Yew reckon them Mesic’ns gonna let four white boys sashay in an’ lift their goods? No way. They got more guns than—
36
JABBER (OS)
We gonna bring Beanie. That’s five. Hack’s daddy’s got plenty o’ guns.
... Pulls a long-barreled Colt Python from his waistband. Triggers several rounds into the television set.
Jabber jumps up. Knocks his chair over.
JABBER
(yells)
Put that damn thang away. What’s yer damn problem?
HACK
Goddamn TV’s broke. I’m gonna miss Sons of Anarchy.
NATE
Now it ain’t comin’ on at all. An’ you’re boostin’ me a new set.
Jabber watches, expression shifting from befuddlement to disbelief, and back.
Bear pushes himself up, rights his cap.
BEAR
(to Hack)
I got some pills that’d help your anger management problem.
Jabber points to the map.
JABBER
It ain’t anger issues. He’s got a brain management problem. Now, git your asses over heah so I can show you idiots what’s goin’ on.
INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT
Foster shudders. Then Megan. Sweat. Silence, but for the gasping. Lovers spent. For now.
Megan wobbles to her feet. Grins. Then she pulls Foster up.
MEGAN
Next time we experiment in bed. Until I find out if this is a dream or real.
LATER - NIGHT
37
FOSTER
Real. No way could I ache this much in a dream ... and the only way you’ll get rid of me is with a shotgun.
Wearing only jockey briefs, Foster lies face down on the bed. In jeans and t-shirt, Megan sits on his butt, gently working a white cream into bruised muscles.
FOSTER
(sucks air) Damn ... that hurts.
The left shoulder and the area over the right kidney are massively bruised.
MEGAN
No blood in your urine?
FOSTER
Kinda late to be thinking about that, but no.
MEGAN
(smiles)
Good. I figured the seduction you mentioned was gonna get put on hold, so I took drastic measures.
FOSTER
Drastic ... or desperate.
Megan grins, bends and kisses the back of his neck.
MEGAN
My knight in skinned-up armor. There’s hope for you yet.  Nice
butt.... Roll over.
EXT. CAMPGROUND - NIGHT
Just beyond the motor home’s rear door, TROY (20s) sits under an opened window. He grins, fondles his left-lobe earring.
MEGAN (VO)
I know three ranch hands who’ve been in prison. They all have tattoos. Why don’t you have any?
38
FOSTER (VO)
Cops notice tattoos. We really don’t need more police attention.
MEGAN (VO)
We. You said we. I think I like that.
Troy squints at his tattooed arms. Silently rises. Tiptoes away.
INT. MOTOR HOME/BEDROOM - NIGHT
Foster again lies on his belly with Megan kneading bruised muscles.
FOSTER
Do you know where all this fascination with butts comes from
... for men and women ... where our idea of that beauty originates?
MEGAN
I’m afraid to ask.
FOSTER
Butts are water carriers. People with flat butts died on long, dry treks through wild country.
MEGAN
Survival traits became objects of beauty.
(pinches his butt) You must be some survivor.
FOSTER
You aren’t doing so bad, either. And we’re in for a rough trip.
MEGAN
A long or short one?
FOSTER
If it’s short, we won’t have to worry about water.
MEGAN
Or anything else.
39
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
Trash. Old bicycles. Wagons. Discarded toys. Oil. Grit. An ancient Ford pickup on concrete blocks near a once-white shack.
Troy on a swing seat, arms looped around rusty chains, beer can between his legs.
TROY
I’m tellin’ ya’ll tha truth. It’s that Garza bitch. For sure.
He gulps beer, then eyes his cohorts, LARRY, ELTON and MIKE. Beer guts. Tattoos. Stained t-shirts. Western and motorcycle boots.
TROY
Twenny-five grand a piece. A fair night’s work.
ELTON
I ain’t doubtin’ yore words, Troy, but how come—
MIKE
I’m with Elton. Why cain’t we jes’ call the po-leece?
LARRY
Up close an’ personal, I heah that bitch is real good to look at.
TROY
My man!
(looks to the others)
As usual, Larry gits right to tha nitty-gritty. I figgered we’d take tha bitch out to Mike’s digs. Have some fun.
MIKE
I’d warsh sheets for somma that!
Troy’s WIFE exits the rear door, heads to the sagging clothes lines carrying a basket of wet laundry.
TROY
Gitcher ass back in tha house! We talkin’ bidness out heah! An’ keep them damn kids inside!
The woman scuttles back through the door.
40
TROY
Ain’t nobody gonna complain if she’s a little banged up.
ELTON
We ain’t—
TROY
Banged ... git it?
Troy hoots at his own wordplay.
ELTON
We ain’t cops. Thet gal killed her ol’ man, an’ the dude with her is the he-goat thet took ‘er outta jail.
MIKE
Yeah. We ain’t nowher’s near qualified for this shit.
LARRY
Bull slobber! I seen DOG on TV! An’ SWAT COPS! That takedown crap ain’t rocket science. We c’n handle it.
Easy.
TROY
Free money an’ a hottie! Ain’t nuthin’ for a bunch of steppers!
MONTAGE - A GROWING LOVE AFFAIR AND PREPARATIONS
—   Foster sits on the tiny table beside the sink. Megan stands between his legs, gently raking a safety razor over his face.
—   On a parking lot outside a Radio Shack, Megan instructs Foster on GPS use.
JABBER (VO)
Anyhow, Alcaraz’s brother eased me out when the jefe went down for bitch slappin’ that fed.
—   In a dusty pickup, Troy and Larry cruise through the campground.
41
JABBER (VO)
Alcaraz likes gringos that don’ speak Mes’c’n. They cain’t unnerstan’ much o’ what they hear, an’ his Mes’c’ns don’ talk gringo.
—   Elton and Mike roll by Foster’s motor home in a junkyard Camaro.
JABBER (VO)
DEA dude always talked English, but I seen ‘im talkin’ ta folks that don’ speak Americ’n ... nary a word.
—   Foster standing in the background, silently shaking his head as Jabber selects a Beretta 9mm and pump shotgun from a car- trunk display.
JABBER (VO)
Rough times. I got no money to buy guns with.
—   Some kind of federal COP waves as the stolen Ford rolls down a parking lot aisle.
FOSTER (VO)
One of the boys. Upstanding members of Club Cop.
JABBER (VO)
Parkin’ spot’s empty. Fedderman could be anywher’, drivin’ anythin’. He don’ report in ever’ few hours like mos’ feds.
—   On a farm road, the Ford cruises past an old, neatly-kept frame house.
JABBER (VO)
Ain’t nuthin’ but hay fields back yonder. Easy ta come up through tha grass at night.
EXT. HAY MEADOW - NIGHT
Lights burn in the frame house. The kitchen. Two people. FEDDERMAN (50s) and CINDY AGUIRRE (15).
Foster, Megan and Jabber sit in knee-high grass.
FOSTER
Who’s the girl?
42
JABBER
Don’ know. Junior high school gash, I reckon. Fedderman’s partial ta young Mes’c’ns.
MEGAN
I thought he’d be rich. A part-time ranch hand could afford this dump.
JABBER
Way I hear it, he’s real careful. Movin’ to Austria when he retires. So I hear. I’ll take tha gal ... little light recreation.
Megan fondles her pistol. Expels exasperated air.
MEGAN
She’s a child, you im—
FOSTER
We scare the kid off, then take him.
JABBER
Fuckin’ do-gooder citizens!
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
Fedderman parts a curtain. He and Cindy peer out. Way down the road, a blue emergency LIGHT blinks.
CINDY            ENGLISH SUPER
Vale más irme. Dame poco   I better go. Gimme some cristál.           blow.
FEDDERMAN          ENGLISH SUPER
Tú sabes donde está. Dejame  You know where it is. poco.            Leave me some.
Seconds later, the door bangs shut.
Fedderman watches the girl scurry to a bike. Race away from the blue light. He straightens. Turns to find ...
FOSTER
... Standing six feet away, turned sideways, .45 pointed at his heart.
Fedderman reflexively reaches for a pistol. No holster attached to his boxer shorts.
43
FOSTER
Kinda hard to play with children and guns at the same time.
As though to deflect bullets, Fedderman holds up his hands.
FEDDERMAN
Now, wait a minute. Do you know who I am?
FOSTER
Somebody with the last name Molester?
FEDDERMAN
Easy. I’m DEA. Pull that trigger, you got no idea how hard this government will go to kill your ass. Besides, she’s fifteen an’ willin’.
FOSTER
Would her father think so?
FEDDERMAN
Jesus Christ! Aguirre sent you! Look! Look, we can make this right. Between you an’ me. I got money. I got ... oh, please. God ... don’t kill me!
Money?
FOSTER
FEDDERMAN
Yeah! Coupla million. In Panama. Numbered accounts. Can be transferred by phone. All you need is my codes. All yours.
Foster shakes his head, but appears to be thinking.
FEDDERMAN
I’ll write it all down. Disappear. I promise. Aguirre’ll never know.
FOSTER
Write. My partner will check this in the morning. Everything’s as you say, I leave. I’ll tell Aguirre you skipped before I got here.
44
EXT. FRAME HOUSE - NIGHT
Still in boxer shorts, a sweating Fedderman stumbles out his front door, Foster prodding him from behind.
Megan parks the Ford. She and Jabber exit as Fedderman steps off his porch.
FEDDERMAN
(to Jabber)
You. Moron! Where do you think you can hide? Alcaraz will—
Foster raises the .45 barrel to the back of the DEA agent’s head. POPS a round.
BLOOD sprays over a swath of lawn. Fedderman drops.
Foster holsters the piece. Plucks orange plugs from his ears. Jabber gapes at him.
MEGAN
(to Jabber)
Seeing is different, huh?
FOSTER
(to Jabber)
So now you know. Shut the fly trap. (to Megan)
Open the trunk.
(to Jabber) Dump him inside.
Foster pulls a garbage bag from a hip pocket. Slips it over Fedderman’s head.
When Jabber closes the deck lid, Megan pulls the car behind the house.
JABBER
Kinda sudden, doncha think?
FOSTER
Answering machine’s on. Message says he’s outta town for a few days. I got all the info we need
... and I know they don’t do last minute calls.
Foster pulls a water hose from a flowerbed. Turns on the faucet. Sprays the bloody grass.
45
JABBER
(posturing)
‘Bout goddamn tired o’ yore attitude, hoss. Wuddn’na been no skin off your nose; you couldda let me have the girl.
FOSTER
I’m not a slaver; so she wasn’t mine to give. And why? You don’t even like girls ... or women.
JABBER
(hand to pistol butt) You callin’ me a fag!
FOSTER
Careful. People die here.
JABBER
Answer my goddamn question!
FOSTER
You claim to like women, but you don’t. You like pussy ... which is a different thing.
Foster bends, retrieves the .45 case. Washes the brass.
FOSTER
Because you like pussy rather than women, your only sexual experience is limited to hookers, or women who hang around you because you get them high.
JABBER
You ain’t—
Foster studies the case. Stuffs into a pocket.
FOSTER
Shut up. You might learn something.
He notices Megan, who stands at the corner of the house ... hand on her pistol. Watching. Listening.
FOSTER
Those kinds of women like neither men nor sex. They like money and dope ... which are different things. To obtain either, they’ll fake just about anything, tell you anything they think you wanna hear.
46
MEGAN (OS)
You’re the john.
FOSTER
(grins)
Your pretty goatee and moustache and your pierced ears tell me that you embrace this immature bullshit, in an effort to seem cool ...
Foster bends for a closer look at the grass. Sprays more water.
FOSTER
... Because some fashion designer has convinced you that those affectations are cool ... a designer, by the way, who doesn’t like women either ... for different reasons.
He returns to the flower bed. Shuts off the water. Megan broadly smiles.
FOSTER
You try to look cool for your buddies ... not for women. For your pals ... so you can sit around, guzzle beer, shoot meth and grunt and fart at each other ...
Foster carefully re-rolls the hose. Exactly as he found it.
FOSTER
... And pretend to be cool while you gab about GITTIN’ pussy, or GITTIN’ money so you can go git pussy. So, what does that make you?
JABBER
Huh?
FOSTER
Probably an arrested fifteen year- old in an adult’s body ... one who deserves nothing better than hookers.
Megan lets out a long sigh, as though she’d been holding her breath.
MEGAN
(chuckles)
Where have you been all my life?
47
FOSTER
In jail ... most likely.
JABBER
Shoulda fuckin’ stayed there.
FOSTER
No way to talk, Jabber, especially since I picked us up another couple of million dollars tonight. We get that, even if we screw up the other score.
JABBER
How’d you do—
FOSTER
Not now. We have work to do. Don’t leave a print inside. We want to pack everything this kiddie-banger might take on a business trip.
Foster: Two steps toward the house. Stops. Thumps his forehead with the heel of his hand.
FOSTER
(to Jabber)
Check the garage. His car. Rope, or wire. Fifty feet. Coupla shovels.
EXT. RADIO SHACK - DAY
Savage and Crafton don hats as they exit the store, guns barely concealed, both looking like clodhopper cops.
Savage stuffs photographs into his shirt pocket, then pulls on wraparound sunglasses with lime green frames.
SAVAGE
Well, we ain’t far b’hind ‘em now.
CRAFTON
Not far enough ... anyways.
SAVAGE
Cool it. Gonna be a different story when he don’t have the drop on us.
CRAFTON
We better worry about Garza.
48
SAVAGE
I ain’t gonna worry. What I’m gonna do is shoot that bitch fulla holes, then butt fuck ‘er b’fore she dies.
EXT. DIRT TRACK, WOODS - DAY
Jabber holds Fedderman upright While Foster, stripped down to jockey briefs, belts the body to the passenger seat of a silver Ford Taurus.
Foster backs out. Shuts the door. Looks up.
Megan straddles a thick branch. Twenty feet above the ground. Keeping watch.
MEGAN
We’re good. Nothing moving anywhere
... but I still don’t like this. Should’ve stayed out of sight until dark.
Jabber grabs an ax. Then, he steps to the stolen Ford.
FOSTER
You think I like it? Day or night?
On the right side of the Taurus, Jabber swings the ax. Once. A second time. Holes in the roof. Behind Fedderman. Then two more in the trunk lid.
JABBER
Ready when you are.
Foster stares at him. Then at the ax work.
JABBER
Air holes. So it sinks.
FOSTER
Good thinking.
Foster climbs into the Taurus. Starts the engine. He backs down the road a hundred yards.
Shifts gears, guns the engine. Forward. The Ford sails over the edge of the sand pit. A dozen feet. Dives into the sand.
Foster crawls out the window. Hangs on to the rain gutter. By his fingertips. Waits. Looks to Jabber.
Jabber shakes out a length of rope. Grins at Foster.
49
JABBER
Might be a good time ta teach you a lesson ‘r two. You reckon?
FOSTER
I die here, Doofus, you’re out a lot of money.
JABBER
Satisfaction. I’d git yore gal to boot. That might be worth it.
A .45 barrel touches Jabber’s neck. A ... THUMB
... Levers down the Safety ... a quiet SNICK.
MEGAN
Dumb, Jabber. You’re a jackass. Don’t you realize that you’re the one who’s no longer needed?
EXT. CAMPGROUND - DAY
Megan and Jabber following, Foster extends his key to unlock the door.
FOSTER
Trap! Trap! Down!
He releases the key, throws himself backward. Grabs a fistful of Megan’s windbreaker. Drags her down as he draws the .45 with his other hand.
A shotgun BLASTS and ... BUCKSHOT
... Rips a jagged hole through the center of the door. Jabber sprints back to the car.
On the ground, Foster and Megan empty .45's into the door and the panels to each side.
INT. MOTOR HOME - SIMULTANEOUS
Larry and Elton: Pinned to each other and the breakfast table. Death dance. .45 slugs pound their bodies.
50
Mike: No effort to use the scoped deer rifle in his hands. He watches. Mouth open. Horrified.
EXT. CAMPGROUND - CONTINUOUS
Mike bursts out the rear door. Carrying the rifle waist high, he runs.
Jabber triggers a 12 gauge round. Buckshot slams into the rifle ... SCOPE
... Propels tube debris and alcohol into Mike’s gut.
Megan and Foster reload. She covers. He races to the car trunk. Troy pops up. Packing a goose gun. Hauling ass.
Megan opens fire first. Then Jabber and Foster join in. Troy skids to pavement on his nose.
Back to the motor home, Megan searches for another target. Foster, likewise, but he turns full circle with the M1A.
FOSTER
(points to Megan) Money! Backpacks!
She cautiously sticks her head inside, then dashes through the door.
FOSTER
(to Jabber)
Back seat! Tear out the screen!
Foster hauls rifles to the front. Climbs into the driver’s seat. Fiddles with pen and paper.
Troy rolls over. Groans. Blinks and squints into the sunlight.
EXT. POST OFFICE PARKING LOT - DAY
Foster slings the Ford into a space. White Fords to either side. Government license plates. Security screens. Blue dash lights.
Radio antennas.
Foster leans forward, rests his head on the steering wheel.
51
Megan and Jabber climb out. Foster follows.
FOSTER
(to Jabber)
Leave the guns. You’re clean. Go home.
But—
JABBER
MEGAN
I’m not going to jail. Walk away! While you can.
Jabber studies Megan’s face a long time, then tosses the Beretta inside.
FOSTER
Your place. Stay there. We’ll meet you. After we shake the cops.
JABBER
(smiles)
You ain’t gon’ leave me hangin’, are you? I jus’ earned a straight answer.
FOSTER
(nods)
Damn right, you did.
(hands Jabber a paper)
If we don’t make it, the transfer is Wednesday night. Thursday at first light, according to Fedderman. At those coordinates.
MEGAN
Do some research while you wait. That will save time later.
Megan hands Jabber a wad of cash.
EXT. STREET - DAY
A Chevy sedan slides around a corner. Accelerates thirty yards. Parked cars on both sides. Tires SMOKE and SQUAWL. The car slews sidewise. Stops. Blocks the narrow lane.
Foster and Megan bail out. He takes the trunk. She, the hood. Rifles.
A police cruiser rounds the corner. Into a veritable storm of lead. The prowl car crashes into a parked pickup truck.
52
Two fat COPS scramble out. Low. No attempt to return fire. Past the parked cars, they break into the open. Run.
A Ford slews around the corner. Brakes and slides to avoid crashing into the abandoned police car.
The Ford’s windshield shatters.
Savage and Crafton scuttle out the driver’s door, and down, backs to wheels. Guns out. Watch the fat cops run.
CRAFTON
Why don’t you git up and shoot?
SAVAGE
Why don’t you?
EXT. LIVESTOCK AUCTION - NIGHT
The VOICE of an auctioneer in the distance.
MEGAN (OS)
(whispers)
If we keep this up, we’ll die.
Spotlights aflash overhead. The WHOP-WHOP of several helicopters.
FOSTER (OS)
(whispers) I know.
Police yelpers.
MEGAN (OS)
(whispers)
I’m scared, Foster. And I’m tired.
COPS with flashlights. Checking parked cars, trucks and trailers.
FOSTER (OS)
I know. Adrenalin does that. When you come down. We need oxygen. A boost.
MEGAN (OS)
(whispers) I have an idea.
FOSTER (OS)
(whispers)
Me, too. Look across the road.
DANGER signs. Chainlink enclosure. Huge electrical transformers.
53
The H&K and M1A open FIRE in unison.
INSULATORS disintegrate. WIRES pop. CABLES unravel. Electrical sparks fly. And ...
OIL
... Spurts onto concrete. Multiple holes. Every transformer. The
... OIL
... Ignites.
More GUNFIRE. A helicopter SPOTLIGHT explodes. The helicopter veers away.
POLICE RADIO (VO)
Stock barn! Lawd, God! Git us some he’p down here!
POLICE RADIO (VO)
Choppers stay back! They got machine guns! Heavy shit!
More police vehicles arrive. Border patrol. Plainclothes COPS. SWAT. They hurriedly encircle Megan and Foster. Then ... the LIGHTS go out.
EXT. CATTLE CORRAL - NIGHT
Foster guzzles water from a trough.
ORTIZ and JOINER tiptoe into the pen ... M-16s pointed at Foster. Joiner has his trousers undone and Ortiz wears only bikini briefs.
ORTIZ
Freeze! Or I’ll give you a new asshole! Real slow ... put your hands b’hind your head. Then you can straighten up and turn aroun’.
(to his partner) Git his weapons, Joiner.
JOINER
Cain’t. I—
ORTIZ
Damnit to hell, you—
54
JOINER
Shut up, Ortiz. I gotta goddamn gun at my head.
Megan stands behind Joiner, rifle barrel touching his neck.
MEGAN
(softly)
You can die ... or live. Your choice. One way or another, you will be quiet.
EXT. SCRUB WOODS & PASTURE/BORDER PATROL SWEEP - NIGHT
At the north end of the search line, the COMMANDER tracks green images through night-vision goggles.
INSERT - NIGHT-VISION BINOCULAR POV
Two FIGURES. Rifles. Gearpacks Border Patrol hats. BACK TO SCENE
A sharply creased eager beaver, WITHERSPOON watches his boss.
WITHERSPOON
You see something, Sir?
The Commander ignores him. Grabs his radio.
COMMANDER
Hey, Lux. I’m trackin’ two subjects laggin’ behind the line about sixty yards east of you. Did you check them out?
At the south end of the search line, LUX shifts his night vision goggles to the figures.
LUX
Saw ‘em earlier. That’s us, Boss.
COMMANDER (VO)
Saw them.... Did ... you ... ID ... them?
LUX (RADIO VO)
I’ll check ‘em again.
(a loud, exasperated breath) The men 60 yards east of the blinkin’ flashlight. Identify yourselves! Now!
55
Up and down the sweep line, rifle and sub gun barrels turn toward the figures.
East of Lux, Foster slowly turns from the flashing light to Megan.
FOSTER
(whispers)
Whatever you do ... no sudden moves.
Now, he turns into moonlight. Tries to read the nametag on his too-large Border Patrol blouse.
MEGAN
(whispers)
If we have to fight, drop straight down, then follow me.
Megan steps close, so he can see her.
FOSTER
(whispers) You’re M.T. Joiner.
MEGAN
(whispers) Albert H. Ortiz.
Foster fumbles Ortiz’s radio from its waist holster.
FOSTER
M.T. Joiner an’ Albert H. Ortiz.
LUX (RADIO VO)
I told you, Boss, that’s us.
Witherspoon slowly shakes his head.
COMMANDER
(into radio mike)
Stand down, everybody. They’re ours.
WITHERSPOON
That is not Ortiz, Sir. His voice is deeper.
Witherspoon grabs his M-16.
56
COMMANDER
(rolls eyes)
So, whoever they are, they just happen to be with our Task Force sweep? And they just happen to know Joiner and Ortiz’s names? That’s how it works?
WITHERSPOON
But—
COMMANDER
And I don’t hear any other Joiner or Ortiz screamin’ that it isn’t them.
Witherspoon checks his loads. Dons goggles.
COMMANDER
What? Are you going out there and shoot somebody? I said, stand down.
WITHERSPOON
That voice was shaky, Commander. Scared.
COMMANDER
Damnit, Witherspoon, Ortiz had forty machineguns aimed in his direction. I’d have been scared, too. Shit, I might’ve started speakin’ Swahili!
WITHERSPOON
But—
COMMANDER
You want to go shoot them, be my guest, but I’m orderin’ you to stand down!
Witherspoon and the Commander glare at each other.
COMMANDER
Well, go on! Kill somebody. I’ll see if I can arrange for you to share an injection stretcher with that crazy bitch we’re chasin’!
EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY
Texas Department of Public Safety TROOPERS and DEPUTIES festooned with riot guns and M-16's.
57
Pigs GRUNT and SQUEAL.
While a DEPUTY looks inside a pickup truck, a TDPS TROOPER walks alongside a stock trailer. At the rear, he peers inside:
A mass of red backs: Duroc hogs crammed flank to flank. The Trooper steps back. Waves the truck DRIVER on.
EXT. SCRUB AND WOODS - DAY
Lux, the Commander, and Witherspoon stand by while PARAMEDICS strap Joiner and Ortiz to stretchers. Ortiz starts to grin at his boss, but changes his mind.
COMMANDER
(to Lux)
“That’s us, Boss.” It was them! Think about that ... while you, Witherspoon, and those two bozos enjoy your administrative leave.
He nods toward Joiner and Ortiz.
WITHERSPOON
Me? I didn’t violate any ... I even warned you!
COMMANDER
Shit rolls downhill, son, and that’s where you stand.
Then he stalks off.
EXT. TRUCKSTOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Pigs SQUEAL. GRUNT. And FART.
Border Patrol uniform splotched with feces and urine, Foster climbs over the trailer’s tailgate. Megan passes filthy rifles and backpacks to him.
MEGAN
I’ve been stepped on about forty thousand times. Peed on. If this is your goddamn idea of a date, I’ll pass next time.
Foster grins. Pulls her face down to his. Kisses her.
58
FOSTER
That little bath was your idea, not mine.
Megan pulls back. Laughs.
MEGAN
Before we get into anything serious, you need another bath and a shave.
FOSTER
Said the pot to the kettle ... but we made it. Again.
MEGAN
And you said WE. Again.
Foster grins, then turns to look at the trailer.
FOSTER
We’re about out of rifle ammo. If we leave the rifles in—
MEGAN
They’ll think we’re heading north.
FOSTER
That we couldn’t cross the border.
MEGAN
I know where to swipe more rifles. An old Galil and an FN. More ammunition than we can haul ... and it’s even farther north. Pistols, too.
A Hispanic TRUCKER walks by. Stops. Turns. He sniffs.
TRUCKER             ENGLISH SUPER
Apestan. A puro mierda de     You stink. Like pig shit. cerdo.
Megan scowls at the man.
MEGAN              ENGLISH SUPER
Estamos filmando una pelicula   We’re in a movie about shitty de policias cagados del cuerpo   ICE cops.
de ICE.
INT. BAR - SAME
Country music. Whiskers. Watery eyes. Grungy people and clothing.
59
Jabber, Nate, Hack, Bear and Beanie. Drunk. Raucous. Shooting meth. Jabber and Nate with a drunken WOMAN hanging on.
A WAITRESS passes beer bottles to Jabber and Beanie. Jabber hands back a fold of bills.
JABBER
Beer for tha house! Ever’body. Includin’ you, sugah.
EXT. STOCK TANK - NIGHT
Docile cattle in small groups around the banks.
Megan: Naked. Waist deep water. Legs and arms wrapped around Foster. She gasps. Clinches. Then ... relaxes.
MEGAN
(sighs)
Ooh, Foster John, your traveling foreplay sucks, but do you ever lend new meaning to the term GOIN’ HARD.
FOSTER
Action makes us want and appreciate sex. Besides, I know how to find good help.
MEGAN
In jails?
FOSTER
Nothing wrong with jails. In this country, Megan, getting yourself busted is damn near a Class A reference.
INT. GAME ROOM - DAY
At a rifle rack, Foster sorts through ammunition boxes.
FOSTER
Your ex-husband’s father may be our life saver.
Megan watches television news.
60
MEGAN
He’s not my ex-husband, Foster. I shot the fucker. Remember? And if I go to Hell, I’ll kill him again with a pitchfork. If I get to Heaven, I’ll carve in his skull with a gold harp.
She switches channels.
MEGAN
My father worked on the ranch over the hill. Since I was a little girl, I wanted to live in this house, with Bobby.
INSERT - TV SCREEN
BACK TO SCENE
JOWLY COP
Them bullets come through one side of tha car an’ out tha other.
FOSTER (OS)
So, you created this neat little fantasy, then stuffed and hammered until you squeezed Bobby and your version of reality into it.
Megan switches channels.
MEGAN
Sometimes, Foster, you’re too damn smart for anybody’s good.
INSERT - TV SCREEN
A news READER and pictures of the motor home flash.
READER (VO)
... Garza and a federal parolee identified as Foster John.
A federal photograph: Long-haired Foster with the beatific smile of the Jesus-possessed.
READER (VO)
Authorities are now certain that Garza and John wrote letters to each other during the last few months of John’s prison sentence.
61
The bullet-riddled door of the motor home flashes. Then Mike’s body.
BACK TO SCENE
READER (VO)
Sheriff Boxerlin told Channel Five News Reporter Blane Southerland that Garza is quote: “An Eve who could charm the serpent in the Garden,” unquote, and that Garza conned John and led him down the path to perdition.
Megan surfs channels.
MEGAN
No shit? I must be some kind of hottie, right? Led you right down the path to perdition.
FOSTER
I can’t argue with the hottie part. And if you live in perdition, would you please book me a room?
ANOTHER READER (VO)
Dallas County authorities describe John as a small-time thief.
MEGAN
Share mine, even if you are a small-time thief.
FOSTER
I never got caught at anything big.
MEGAN
Come on! Reality check: You never did anything big ... until now.
Millions of dollars.
Foster sets a shotgun on the rack. Turns around.
FOSTER
I ... I.... This score is small- time, Megan. Biggest thing in my life was walking you outta that jail.
MEGAN
(sudden tears) I’m ... I ... not—
62
FOSTER
Sh-h. Not now. Later. We still have work to do.
Foster pulls down a Smith & Wesson riot gun.
FOSTER
Jabber oughtta love this.
MEGAN
He conned me.
FOSTER
Jabber?
MEGAN
Bobby. So nice. Well-mannered. He brought me here to meet his father. So I could see this place. We were going to live here.
Foster loads ammo boxes into a backpack.
MEGAN
I knew he used speed, coke when he couldn’t score meth, but didn’t know he was strung out. Makes me a prize rube.
Foster kneels in front of her. Hands on her knees.
FOSTER
Anyone can get conned. Nobody is immune. I convinced a gang of experts that I was blank-eyed Christian with nothing but Jesus on the brain.
Megan chuckles.
FOSTER
Big black Bible. Church. Meetings. Lived on my knees to get up on my feet. I’m never living on my knees again. For anyone. For any reason.
Megan surfs channels.
INSERT - TV SCREEN
Images flash past a scene in a hospital room. Back up.
63
Troy: Lying in a bed. Left wrist cuffed to the bed rail.
Intravenous fluids running. REPORTERS. His tired wife standing at the head of the bed. Tentatively smiling. Holding a baby.
A uniformed DEPUTY sits in one corner.
TROY
My friends were he-roes, an’ now tha law’s done charged me with breakin’ an’ enterin’.
REPORTER
Mr. Haskell, uh ... Troy, the police believe you were after the reward posted for Megan Garza.
TROY
We wus jist tryin’ to do our duty as citizens. That woman killed Bobby an’ she ain’t got no bidness walkin’ aroun’ free.
Troy looks up to his wife.
TROY
Hon, would you ask that nurse to bring me somethin’? My side is killin’ me.
WIFE
You jus’ had a shot an hour ago.
Troy, obviously, swallows his anger.
TROY
Oh, I forgot.
REPORTER
The sheriff’s office spokesperson said—
BACK TO SCENE
TROY

Don’t ya’ll git it? That Garza bitch is tha killer, not me!
Furious, Megan clicks the OFF button. Very slowly turns to look at Foster, who doesn’t notice.
64
EXT. ROADSIDE TABLE - DAY
On the road shoulder, Savage sits on the Ford’s fender chewing a grass stem. Crafton stands nearby while state COPS go over the truck and pig trailer.
CRAFTON
You know, bud, we need to turn on the cell phones an’ let our nuts down.
SAVAGE
Like you did when them other two nuts was shootin’ at us?
CRAFTON
We were hearin’ three oh eight rounds, genius. Sail right through a kevlar vest.
SAVAGE
You think I’m too dumb to know the sound? I been trained jus’ like—
CRAFTON
Anyhow, Sheriff’s gonna fry our asses if we don’ git in touch. I expect facin’ that gal an’ her boyfriend would be a bit easier.
The pair watches Reeves and Henning—their right arms cocked 90 degrees from their bodies, elbows cocked 90 degrees with hands forward, in plaster casts—approach a TDPS TROOPER near the trailer. The Trooper jerks a thumb toward the Ford.
CRAFTON
Company.
SAVAGE
Yeah! Git a loada her.
Henning following, Reeves stumbles up, holding out his left hand to shake.
REEVES
David Reeves, Dallas PD. (cocks his head)
Pat Henning. Same department.
CRAFTON
Dallas PD ... suspended an’ a little pissed off, I reckon.
That, too.
65
REEVES
HENNING
More than a little. I don’t want this creep struttin’ around some prison braggin’ about how he took my guns.
Crafton suddenly sucks in his belly. Straightens. Chuckles.
CRAFTON
Carl Crafton. He’s Buel Savage, an’ ya’ll sound a whole lot alike. My partner wants to shoot that Garza gal full of holes, then butt fuck her b’fore she dies.
HENNING
(beams at Savage) Sounds like fun. Can I watch?
Savage drops into aw-shucks mode.
CRAFTON
I expect ya’ll’re down here lookin’ for a little gitback.
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
SAVAGE (VO)
Best chance for that is stakin’ out that campground. Foster’s got cash, and we figger he stashed some there.
Sporting a blond wig, wearing a summer dress with an ogle-me cleavage, Megan sits at a window table ... nibbling salad ... lost in thought.
Across the aisle, BART (70s) ogles Megan. Grins and smacks lips.
BART
I know yew!
Megan blinks. Looks at Bart. Shakes her head.
BART
Yeah ... I seen yew on television.
Megan glances around the dining room. Again shakes her head. Her HAND drifts toward a large purse on the bench.
66
BART
Yeah ... yew’re in one o’ them soap op’ries.
Megan pulls her purse onto her lap.
BART
(winks) Bart Rudisill.
Bart grabs his coffee. Rises. Hobbles. Gimpy. Slides into her booth without an invitation.
BART
Purty good line, ain’t it? Didn’t see ya on no teevee, but I know yew.
Megan grits.
On her LAP, she slips the .45 halfway out. THUMBS down the safety.
BART
Not chew, personally, unnerstan’?
Megan cocks an eyebrow.
BART
But. ... Wal, yew’re a workin’ gal, ain’tcha?
Megan sighs. Rolls her eyes.
BART
Good motel aroun’ the corner. I ain’t much to look at, but yew an’ me c’n leave scorch marks onna pair o’ sheets.
Now Megan grins.
Slides the pistol into her purse.
BART
Hunnert bucks?
Her grin fades.
Bart holds up two fingers.
She scowls. Folds arms under her breasts.
67
BART
Yew some kinda stickup artist?
Megan can’t hold it in. She laughs.
Bart grabs his coffee. Levers both elbows onto the table. He sips. Shrewd.
BART
Five hunnert! Final offer.
A horn TOOTS outside.
MEGAN
I wouldn’t take your money for anything in the world. Don’t need it. Scorch marks, huh?
Foster climbs from a dark, dust-covered Buick sedan with tinted windows.
Foster winks when Megan looks his way. Smiles. She smooches at Bart. Grabs her check.
MEGAN
My boyfriend. Son of a bitch always shows up at the wrong time.
Mouth opened. Stupified. Bart drops his cup, which shatters the saucer.
INT. BUICK - DAY
Megan climbs in ... gives a full-cleavage view to Foster.
FOSTER
Wow! The scenery improves big time.
MEGAN
(grits)
Where are my jeans and shirt? I hate this damn dress ... people staring at me.
FOSTER
Well, it worked, didn’t it? I’d bet that no one paid any attention to your face.
68
MEGAN
(chuckles)
A teenager wanted my autograph. He thought I was a country singer. One old man propositioned me. Five hundred bucks.
FOSTER
What? Did he want a lay-away plan? That’s not even a decent down payment ... from what I’ve seen.
MEGAN
(smiles now)
You ... ain’t ... seen nothin’ ... yet. Now, where are they?
FOSTER
Suitcase: In the trunk.
MEGAN
Stop oglin’ and fetch!
She pulls the offending dress over her head.
Through the window, BART watches. Practically drooling.
EXT. MARINA - NIGHT
Foster and Megan lurk behind a dumpster, watching the Floatin’ Turd.
MEGAN
Should’ve bought night-vision gear.
FOSTER
I know. We’ll do it tomorrow.
The houseboat rolls with the lap of water. Dim light through the living room window. The flicker-flash of a television set.
MEGAN
Do you think he’s in there?
FOSTER
Unless he went out through the bottom and swam away.
MEGAN
Then, why are we waiting here? Why don’t we go on in?
69
FOSTER
Just being cautious.
Headlights illuminate the road. Megan and Foster duck until the car passes.
MEGAN
So, you don’t trust him. I don’t either. Are you going to kill him?
Foster blows air. Slowly shakes his head.
FOSTER
We don’t have to like him, but he is our partner, and until he makes a wrong move, we treat him like one.
MEGAN
You aren’t the one he wants to hogtie and rape. I left Savage alive when I shouldn’t have. And Buster. Now other women may suffer because of my mistake.
FOSTER
I know. But ... for all Jabber knew, those were cops at the campground. He could’ve cut and run
... but he got down, Meg.
MEGAN
And you have to respect that.
FOSTER
As much as I respect a woman who refuses to be passed around like a tray of meat snacks.
MEGAN
Are you saying that you respect that tub of lard as much as you respect me?
FOSTER
Don’t stuff your thoughts into my mouth. I respect that one act.
MEGAN
Fine. Let’s hope he has more where that came from.
70
INT. HOUSEBOAT - MORNING
Bleary-eyed and hung over, Jabber stumbles into his living room. Stops at the door.
Megan and Foster sit on the sofa.
Megan pulls a container of take-out coffee from a sack. Wordlessly offers it to Jabber.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS SIDE - DAY
Buick parked near the asphalt road. Megan and Foster under backpacks. Jabber packs his shotgun, wears his pistol and has a rifle slung over a shoulder.
MEGAN
This is dangerous. The Border Patrol uses ground radar.
Jabber hands Foster a GPS unit. Foster compares coordinate numbers with those on a second unit.
JABBER
Too far out. Too far for wetbacks ta walk w’thout gittin’ spotted an’ somebody callin’ tha law.
Foster seems not to hear. He studies terrain. A wide expanse of grass. Mostly dried by summer heat and drought. Dusty grass.
Brush and trees near the river.
FOSTER
Fedderman’s or the Border Patrol cop’s choice. You can bet it’s safe.
MEGAN
That kind of bet can get us killed.
FOSTER
(to Jabber)
Take the car back. Pick us up at two tomorrow afternoon. I want to get the feel of this place.
JABBER
I ain’t gon’ drive aroun’ in no hot car. Three of us cud raise ‘nough ruckus ta git away. By myself, I’d end up in jail.
71
FOSTER
The Buick is cool. It belongs to a cop who’s in Oklahoma testifying in a trial. He won’t be back for a week.
MEGAN
The registration is in the glove box.
FOSTER
Plenty of time, Jabber. Three days. So, cool it. Let’s do this right.
Megan passes Jabber a wad of bills and a shopping list.
MEGAN
Go to Brownsville. Buy what’s on the list. Anything else you think we’ll need. Foster and I have to stay outside. No hotels or motels.
FOSTER
Food. High-protein stuff. Beef sausage and cheese.
MEGAN
Real beer. Not Foster’s sissy brew. Dos Equis.
Foster sticks out his tongue at her.
Jabber hoofs back to the car, Foster watching his path.
FOSTER
Wide, outside circles, Meg. You want to take a look at something, go way out, then back in.
Megan smiles at him.
LATER
MEGAN
No trails or tracks that start on the dirt road.
Foster and Megan brush away tire tracks and footprints with willow branches.
72
EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS SIDE - NIGHT
No fire, but Megan and Foster have a camp, sort of. In high grass away from the river, they lie on a ground tarp, naked, sweaty, with weapons and gear from the backpacks scattered around them.
FOSTER
Too bad we weren’t fifteen at the same time. We’d really have been good at this by now.
Megan stares at stars, the back of her head resting on his belly. She smiles.
MEGAN
Robbing dope gangsters?
FOSTER
That, too. But I was talking about sex.
MEGAN
I think we’re pretty good now. Gonna get lots better.
He chuckles, then laughs.
Megan sits up, spins, lies on her belly beside him. Her face close to his.
MEGAN
What? What’s so funny?
FOSTER
Not funny.
Tears suddenly leak from Foster’s eyes.
MEGAN
What?
FOSTER
(sighs)
Bugs chewing our butts. In a field
... middle of nowhere. Every cop in Texas wanting to kill us ... and I don’t think life gets any better than right here ... right now.
MEGAN
Foster, I don’t think I—
73
FOSTER
Spit it out, Megan. Something’s been bugging you.
MEGAN
You didn’t see the creep on television. You were busy.
FOSTER
The idiot we didn’t kill. I saw him.
MEGAN
(sits up)
I gave Savage and his buddy a pass
... when I should have killed them before leaving that jail. I can’t give Troy Haskell a pass. Not any more. Not since I met you.
FOSTER
Okay. After the score, we—
MEGAN
Foster, do you understand that this dim-witted redneck wanted to lock me in a cage? For a few dollars.
For thirty seconds on some TV news show.
FOSTER
So. You’re leaving?
MEGAN
My self-respect tells me I have to do this.
FOSTER
And I have a score to take down.
MEGAN
We can’t do everything together. We—
FOSTER
We have to do everything together. Or separately, altogether. Do you understand? We can’t trust anyone else.
MEGAN
Then you’ll have to help me.
74
FOSTER
Bullshit. We can do that after the score.
MEGAN
No. I’m not putting this off. I get killed on this robbery of yours, that creep gets away. I—
FOSTER
Sh-h. Headlights coming.
Staying low, they scramble to get dressed and armed.
FOSTER
I’ll watch them. You load the packs.
A Border Patrol Bronco parks on the dirt track.
MEGAN
(whispers) Checking the territory.
She settles beside Foster. Buttons her shirt. Arranges extra magazines for the Galil.
FOSTER
(whispers)
If it’s our guy. If not, there’ll be more coming, and we are in deep shit.
MEGAN
(whispers) Your guy.
The Bronco’s front windows lower, but for long seconds, the DRIVER stays inside.
At last the beefy driver clambers out ... squeaking and rattling all the way. He wears woodland cammies ... his pistol slung low. Modern military chic.
He switches on a long flashlight. Walks from the truck to the riverbank. Checking for tracks.
FOSTER
(whispers)
He spots us, no gunfire. We run. He won’t call for backup. Maybe he’ll think we’re illegals.
75
MEGAN
(whispers)
With assault rifles? Fat chance.
Now the Border Patrolman checks the brush and boulders along the water.
Foster raises up, watches:
The Patrolman sweeps the grass on the opposite side of the dirt road with the flashlight beam.
Foster hurriedly ducks.
Shit!
FOSTER
(whispers)
The beam passes over them.
MEGAN
(whispers) What’s he doing?
The light returns, lingers ... then flicks away.
FOSTER
(whispers)
Checkin’ for trampled grass.
MEGAN
(whispers) Damnit!
LATER - DAY
From high weeds and under scorching sunlight, Megan and Foster watch two Army Corps of Engineers EMPLOYEES unload a sixteen foot canoe from a rooftop rack and stash it in the river brush.
FOSTER
Home free. We’re on ... this is gonna be a piece of cake.
MEGAN
That water’s waist deep. Max. Forty, maybe fifty yards wide. So what’s the boat for?
FOSTER
So Fedderman makes only one trip. He’d most likely drag it across.
Foster gestures toward the hundred fifty yard wide riverbed.
76
FOSTER
They can’t hang around in daylight.
Or long enough for a bunch of
trips through puddles, wet sand and water. Somebody could spot him.
Call cops.
MEGAN
They are the cops.
She scans the area. Plainly displeased.
MEGAN
This sucks, Foster. I’ve been hunting since I was little ... and this sucks.
FOSTER
Why?
MEGAN
I don’t like having to stay this far back. That riverbank is three to four feet high. Sand bottom. An army could crawl in at night and you wouldn’t see or hear them.
Rocks to hide behind.
Megan points at an eight by eight foot wellhouse.
FOSTER
So? The river has obviously changed its course since that was built.
Megan stares at him.
MEGAN
What the hell does that have to do with anything? It’s concrete, Foster. Old, but still concrete.
FOSTER
Solid cover if we need it.
MEGAN
(blows, exasperated)
Yeah ... if it isn’t already occupied by someone else who also needs cover. And if you need it ... not me.
77
FOSTER
We have to take chances sometimes. We stay back. No tracks. No trampled grass.
Megan stares at him, for long, long seconds.
MEGAN
You. Not me.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
The Buick. Parked off a dirt track. Sleeping bags slung across the roof. Foster sorting groceries on the hood. Sipping non- alcoholic beer.
Jabber pulls a long, half inch nylon rope from the trunk, tosses it onto a sleeping bag.
FOSTER
What’s that for?
JABBER
I dunno. It was on the list.
Foster looks at Megan, who sips Mexican beer while repacking a backpack.
MEGAN
You never know. I thought it might come in handy.
She buttons a stubborn side pocket. Does not look up. Foster watches her. Cocks his head.
FOSTER
(under his breath)
Nah.
Now he stares at the rope. Fascinated. When he looks back, Megan is gone.
LATER:
Foster works his cautious way through underbrush. Hand resting on the .45 butt.
He finds Megan beside a creek. Sitting on a rotten log. He steps on a twig. SNAP.
She rises and wheels. Pistol pointed at his chest. Stares at him. Long seconds before she engages the safety.

MEGAN
If we’re going to argue, I’d rather not bother.
She resumes her seat. Puts the Wilson away. Foster squats in front of her.
FOSTER
What makes you think that I can let you walk away from this? Or that Jabber will?
MEGAN
You’re soft, Foster. That’s what.
FOSTER
And Jabber?
MEGAN
(derisive snort)
Him, I’d kill. He knows that ... and he knows that I can.
FOSTER
How soft, Megan, if I decide that you know too much to be allowed to leave?
MEGAN
That’s Jabber ... speaking through you. What he has must be contagious.
FOSTER
And if it isn’t?
MEGAN
Then one of us is going to die. Right here.
As though a bulb lights in his brain, Foster’s mouth drops open. His gaze widens.
FOSTER
Damn! The rope! To pull yourself out of the quicksand. You were plannin’ on killin’ ME.
MEGAN
Only if you broke weak, Foster. I’m through allowing weak men to fuck me over.
79
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Foster stands beside a white van.
Megan sits behind the steering wheel. She fires a cigarette. Passes it to him.
FOSTER
Are you gonna be okay?
MEGAN
Come on, Foster! Who knows? Am I going to be satisfied after I shoot this animal ... you bet.
She lights a cigarette for herself.
MEGAN
Don’t make this harder than it is. Okay?
She turns her face to smile at him, Foster bends. Gently kisses her lips. Then, he turns. Walks away.
INT. BUICK - DAY
Jabber drives while a silent Foster gazes out the window.
JABBER
That was a mistake. Bitch gets busted, she’s gonna squeal like a pig.
FOSTER
If you ever learned how to shut up, now would be a real good time to recall the lesson.
INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
Loud music from a CD player and tiny, makeshift speakers.
Nate guzzling beer, alternately licking the back of a fat, fourteen year old GIRL who lies facedown on the floor.
Bear and Hack dance with a pair of junior high GIRLS, one wearing panties and a t-shirt, the other nothing.
Beanie, two BOYS and another GIRL work over a nasty mirror, lining and snorting.
80
Cindy—panties and a fold of money stuck in her bra—sits with Jabber, on his lap, sharing a pipe.
JABBER
Stick with me, Cindy. Ah’m gonna be tha big honcho aroun’ heah.
CINDY
My boyfrien’ say you go to preeson.
JABBER
I gave Fedderman breathin’ cancer. Ain’t nobody sendin’ me ta prison ag’in. Never.
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
Savage steers through the campground. Crafton points to a Ford Sedan.
CRAFTON
That’s it. Pull in behind ‘em.
When Savage brakes, Henning raises up in the Ford’s rear window. Then Reese’s hairy ASS shines as he scrambles for the front seat.
CRAFTON
Damn! How’d they manage that with them big ol’ casts on?
SAVAGE
Don’ know, but I shore would like to try with her.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Megan sits behind the wheel of the van. Smoking. Watching the hospital across the street.
A TDPS cruiser and ambulance at the side entrance. Two police department prowl cars at the emergency entrance.
MEGAN
Shit!
From the front, a lone figure appears. Jeans. Windbreaker. Running shoes. Foster.
Go away.
MEGAN
81
Hands in jacket pockets, he crosses the street. Tries the passenger door. Locked.
Megan leans over. Hesitates. Glares up at him. Lifts the locking post.
Foster slides into the seat.
MEGAN
Waste of breath, Foster. I won’t be talked out of this.
He pulls three loaded .45 magazines from a pocket. Passes them to her.
Megan shoves the clips into a hip pocket. Stares out and smokes. Foster fires one of her Marlboros.
A bow-legged TDPS TROOPER swaggers out. Crawls into his cruiser and departs.
Megan draws on her cigarette, then grabs the wheel with the hand that holds the smoke. The ...
HAND
... Shakes. Smoke wafts upward in a jagged streamer.
MEGAN
Scared, Foster. So fucking scared.
FOSTER
You’ll feel better inside. We’ll find the locker room. Steal a nurse’s uniform.
MEGAN
I didn’t come here to play games or to take drama lessons. All I want is to shoot this son of a bitch.
FOSTER
What’s the plan?
MEGAN
Improvise. Plans don’t work once the lead starts whizzing by.
FOSTER
Do you even know the territory?
82
MEGAN
Sure. Kids in my high school partied around here. Ran from beer- busting cops.
FOSTER
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that with all the dope problems along this border, cops still arrest high school kids over beer?
MEGAN
Sure. One of their main targets.
Foster remains silent.
The city COPS exit ... and depart.
MEGAN
Let’s go.
SERIES OF SECURITY CAMERA SHOTS:
1)  Megan and Foster crossing the street. Foster trailing a few paces. Scanning.
2)  Megan striding down a hospital corridor as though she owns the place.
3)  Climbing stairs. Foster still trailing Megan. Both stuffing ears with orange foam protectors.
4)  Down a long corridor. Megan in front. Foster palms an extra magazine. An Hispanic ORDERLY mops the floor.
INT.. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Troy sleeps.
His wife dozes in a chair near the window.
A DEPUTY drops his magazine. Starts to rise as Megan enters. Reaches for his pistol.
No hesitation. She POPS two quick rounds to the man’s chest. Troy’s wife bolts upright. SCREECHES.
WHOOF! Breath explodes. The cop sits back on his chair. GASPS.
Troy opens his eyes. Megan FIRES. Three rounds. A fourth ... which catches Troy under his nose.
83
The Haskell woman SCREAMS and WAILS. Megan starts to turn.
The Deputy starts to rise.
Megan aims for his face. Pauses ... then BLASTS a third and fourth round into his chest.
He grimaces. Drops to the floor. Arms folded across his chest. Again gasping.
Megan reloads. Swings the piece to Troy’s wife. Hesitates. Shakes her head. Then strides to the door.
INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Foster points his weapon at the Orderly. Megan steps out.
MEGAN              ENGLISH SUPER
¡Quedate allí!          Stay there!
Megan jogs down the hall. Past elevators to the fire exit.
Stops. Pivots to cover Foster’s retreat as an elevator bell pings and the ...
DOOR
... Opens. Out steps a security GUARD.
The Guard spots Megan. Starts to draw his pistol.
Foster dashes forward on silent feet. Lays his .45 barrel to the Guard’s ear.
FOSTER
Hands out front. Way out.
The Guard obeys.
Foster takes the man’s automatic. Pats him down.
FOSTER
Go help your co-worker mop the floor.
Megan trips the fire alarm. Yelpers SHRIEK. Then ...
84
PA SYSTEM
Please walk to the nearest exit. Do not run. Aid the infirm, and please walk to the nearest exit. Do not run.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Foster: Blue scrub sheet over his lap. Head hung to one side. Mouth opened. He drools. Sits in a wheelchair.
Megan: White lab coat. She pushes Foster right past a pair of city cops. Turns a corner. Stops.
Four COPS at the van.
FOSTER
Keep going. Down the side of the building.
She turns. Half a dozen steps.
COP
Hey, you! With the wheelchair! Hold up a second!
MEGAN
My ass!
As Megan wheels, Foster flicks away the sheet. Too far to hit anyone, but they BLAST away.
Cops scramble for cover. Megan and Foster haul ass.
EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
In the dark, Megan and Foster walk along a taxiway, Megan, catching her breath.
FOSTER
Shit! We lost the Galil!
MEGAN
(gasping)
No ... hid it in the ... park ... by the floodway.
FOSTER
Did you kill the deputy?
85
MEGAN
No need.
(grins, sucks air)
But he’ll sure have sore ribs by breakfast time.
Hounds BAY behind them.
MEGAN
Tracking dogs. We’re in trouble.
FOSTER
Trees. Find trees.
EXT. PARK - NIGHT
Under a big oak, Foster stops. Megan right behind him. The hounds continuously BAY in the distance.
MEGAN
Cat hounds. Tear us to pieces.
FOSTER
When I bend, crawl up my back. Don’t churn up the ground. Leave tracks. Grab that limb above and climb as high as you can.
MEGAN
What if they spot me?
FOSTER
They won’t look up as long as the dogs have a trail. They’re following. Not searching.
MEGAN
Foster, we shouldn’t—
FOSTER
There isn’t a cop in Texas who can run as far as I can, nor as fast.
MEGAN
Give me a minute to catch my breath.
FOSTER
After they pass, get—
86
MEGAN
You are not playing decoy. We’re four blocks from my rifle. That’ll slow them down.
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
Behind a restaurant, Foster again pauses to allow Megan to catch her breath.
Foster pulls her into the doorway cover. Rotors THOP overhead. Exhaust RATTLES. A searchlight beam dances up the alley, then disappears and noise fades.
Gasping, Megan also sniffs. Looks around. Spots a grease trap receptacle. Points.
In the distance: Police radios SQUAWK; hounds BAY.
FOSTER
What?
MEGAN
(breathing ragged)
Tuck jeans ... into ... tops of socks.
What for?
Do it!
FOSTER MEGAN
She bends. Wads her jean cuffs. Jams them into sock elastic. Foster shakes his head but follows her lead.
Next, Megan fastens her windbreaker ... all the way through the top snap.
At the grease trap, she slathers her hands and wrists with the brown goo, then her face, neck and hair.
FOSTER
What the h—
MEGAN
No time ... do it!
Foster dips his hands.
87
FOSTER
(grins at her)
Every time you get a bright idea, I need a dozen boxes of Tide and two weeks’ scrubbing to get clean.
Megan smooches at him. Pads to the end of the alley.
EXT. PARK - NIGHT
With lights out, a police car passes on the street. Seconds later, Megan and Foster dash across the asphalt ... into the park’s shrubbery and trees.
Megan halts. Bends and strains. Uproots a small shrub.
MEGAN
Stand still.
She brushes him all over with the bush.
FOSTER
Are you going to explain? Or is this secret girl stuff?
MEGAN
Dogs follow dead skin cells. With cuffs tied and the grease, we won’t be leaving any.
She brushes his back.
MEGAN
They’ll start to lose us here. By the time we grab my rifle, there won’t be any trail to follow.
Foster turns. Gapes.
MEGAN
I told you; I grew up one of the boys.
FOSTER
(silently whistles)
No mature male, Megan Garza, me least of all, would ever mistake you for one of the boys.
He bends to kiss her, but she backs away.
88
MEGAN
Not now. You’re nasty, you stink, and you need a shave.
EXT. ROADSIDE REST STOP - DAY
Foster, Jabber and Megan huddle, a map spread over the Buick’s hood.
FOSTER
We’ll use the cop’s vehicle to get out. We can leave the Buick right there.
Foster points to a spot on the map.
FOSTER
It’s remote, ranch country with no cattle on the grass now. Megan says nobody’s apt to find it.
JABBER
Come on! That’s a good twelve, fourteen miles away. I damn shore ain’t walkin’ that far!
FOSTER
I’ll drop you and Megan with the weapons. I can run it in an hour and a half. Less, if I really push it.
(to Megan)
I’ll need liquids ... after. Lots of liquids.
Both Megan and Jabber stare at him. Disbelieving.
EXT. DIRT TRACK/RIO GRANDE - DAY
Megan unloads gear from the Buick’s trunk while Jabber and Foster cart packs into high grass and brush.
JABBER
This is pure bullshit ... waitin’ out here damned near all day an’ ALL night.
89
FOSTER
Mind your tracks. Don’t wade through tall grass if there’s a lotta dust on it. You’ll leave a trial for some airborne cop to spot.
JABBER
We’re gonna git eat up with chigger bites.
FOSTER
Mosquitoes, too. That’s what the insect repellant’s for ... use it.
INT. BAR - DAY
Nate, Hack and Bear suck on beer bottles.
NATE
This ain’t good. Shit’s fixin’ ta go wrong.
HACK
We’re all right. Jabber said this could happen. He’s thinkin’ about six car-lengths ahead of that Foster dude, an’ it’s a real short track.
BEAR
Yeah. He always was smart. Where tha fuck is Beanie? That’s what I wanta know.
EXT. DIRT TRACK/RIO GRANDE - DAY
Megan stands tall in grass. Alone. Pistol on her belt. Rifle slung over her left shoulder, a nylon sling of ammunition pouches over her right shoulder. Looking utterly forlorn as the Buick pulls away.
INT. TRASHY RESIDENTIAL GARAGE - DAY
Nate and Bear check shotguns, rifles and handguns. Hack enters, a Colt Python stuck into his jeans.
90
HACK
We gotta problem. That was Beanie on tha horn. He’s in jail up in Hebbronville.
Bear and Nate look at each other, then shake heads.
NATE
We ain’t got tha time or tha money to bail his ass out.
BEAR
He was supposta be here. What the hell’s he doin’ way up yonder anyway?
NATE
He said he knew where ta git a coupla grenades.
BEAR
Bullshit. He was cuttin’ farts ... out his mouth.
HACK
So he misses out?
Bear and Nate nod.
HACK
Splittin’ his share ain’t gonna bust my heart.
BEAR
Yeah, ‘xcept now we’re one gunhand short.
NATE
Hack was in the Navy. He c’n show us what ta do.
BEAR
Yeah, a whole three months. Real fightin’ sailor.
HACK
(sniffs, morose)
Yeah. Woulda been a SEAL if that chickenshit JG hadn’t busted me shootin’ meth.
91
EXT. PLAINS - DAY
The Buick parked under spindly trees. Cattle grazing.
Foster: Running shorts. Nike shoes. No socks. No shirt. Wraparound sunglasses.
He opens the trunk, pulls a Gatorade bottle from ice and sets it on the chest. Removes a camouflage parachute. Dumps it onto the ground. Stands long seconds. Studies the coil of rope on the trunk carpet. He grins.
Foster guzzles Gatorade.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME
Beanie chugs half a bottle of beer. He leans against the rear wall. Looks around:
Henning and Savage sit on the edge of a bed. Close. She thumbs the lid on a pill bottle. Gobbles one. Tosses the bottle to ...
... Reeves, who catches it. Plops into a chair near the front window. His cast brace THUNKS against the chair arm. Swallows two capsules.
Crafton stands by the dresser. Looking wary.
BEANIE
I git all the reward money.
HENNING
What’s to keep me from shootin’ off your teenie little pecker ... before I start asking questions?
Reeves pulls a nickel-plated .50 caliber Desert Eagle. Lays the pistol on the table.
BEANIE
(blusters)
Talk that shit to somebody who ain’t never done time. You got too many eyes scopin’ your action.
EXT. PLAINS - DAY
Foster watching the ground, running at an easy, mile-eating lope. Breathing easily. Sweating profusely.
92
EXT. WELLHOUSE, RIO GRANDE - DAY
Megan leans against the rear wall while a helicopter passes overhead.
Jabber looms in the doorway. Grinning at her.
MEGAN
Take a spot in the grass ... directly between the wellhouse and the clump of willows I pointed out.
JABBER
Somebody elect you shotcaller?
Megan shakes her head. Disgust. Impatience.
MEGAN
Will you ever learn?
He tries to stare her down.
MEGAN
I was reared in wide open spaces. Crowd me. I get itchy ... in my index fingers.
Ever so slowly, Jabber backs out the door.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Beanie: Shirtless. Chest a bloody mess. Crescent-shaped and circular cuts. Arms stretched upward. Silver duct across his mouth.
Big green garbage bags cover tile and carpet.
Beanie hangs. His hands taped to a pull-up bar wedged in the bathroom doorway. Eyes swollen nearly shut.
Still, he looks pleadingly at ... HENNING
... Who stands in front of him, holding a broken beer ... BOTTLE
... In her good hand.
CRAFTON (OS)
I expect that boy’s about ready to answer your questions.
93
Beanie nods. Vigorously.
Crafton sits on the dresser’s suitcase slot, one leg crossed over the other. He nips at coffee.
Reeves and Savage occupy chairs at the front of the room.
Beanie sucks a whistling breath through clogged nostrils as Henning digs the bottle into his side and twists.
HENNING
A reminder. Should you turn stubborn again.
She steps back. Grabs a towel, holds it in her uplifted right hand and cleans her left.
EXT. DIRT TRACK/RIO GRANDE - DAY
Megan stands by the asphalt road, hands Foster a towel. Kisses him the second he dries his face, then hands him a big bottle of phony beer.
FOSTER
First real run since I got out. A cigarette sure would be good.
Always is ... after a hard run.
EXT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Reeves opens the trunk to the deputies’ Ford. He carefully scrutinizes the lot, then nods toward the room’s door.
Crafton and Savage struggle through and between cars. Stuff Beanie’s blanket-wrapped body into the trunk.
Reeves closes the lid, again looks around.
REEVES
We’re good. Ya’ll go. We’ll clean the room. Henning used to work in the lab. She knows how.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Reeves wipes blood flecks from the bathroom door frame while Henning sits on a bed, typing one-handed on a laptop.
REEVES
Kind of taken a shine to Savage, haven’t you?
94
HENNING
Not that big a shine. I don’t gripe because you have sex with your wife
... even when I can smell the bitch on you. So butt out.
Reeves grits. Anger right on the surface.
REEVES
She’s not here. You are!
HENNING
Raise your voice at me again, little boy, I just might have more blood to clean up.
REEVES
And I might just kill you ... someday.
HENNING
No, David, you won’t. Because without me, you don’t have ANY balls.
(looks up ... finally)
We now have resignations officially on file.
Reeves swallows anger. Grins. Winks at her, then salutes. The Duke with a jacked-up arm.
REEVES
With those and the suspensions, no one can contest our claim to that reward.
HENNING
We’ll have that, and whatever we pick up on the river.
REEVES
You mean you believed that scuz?
HENNING
Partly. I think there’s going to be money to be had, just not the amount he said.
REEVES
God, I been wantin’ outta Dallas since I was a kid.
HENNING
Yeah. Where you going?
95
REEVES
Little Rock.
HENNING
(smiles) You scared?
REEVES
No ... yeah. A little. But these hicks know their weapons. So we oughta be okay.
HENNING
Pick your spot; do what I tell you, and we’ll do okay. Maybe sell part of the story to a movie company. Be famous. For sure, we walk away with ALL the money.
INT. VAN - NIGHT
Nate drives. Looks over his shoulder when Bear racks the slide on a shotgun. Hack wipes the Python with a rag.
HACK
We damn sure better have all tha guns back by tomorra. My daddy finds out we took ‘em, he’ll call tha police.
BEAR
I’m a helluva lot more worried ‘bout whut my ol’ lady’s gonna say ‘bout bein’ gone so long.
NATE
We’re done, you can divorce the fat bitch, head out ta Vegas an’ buy one o’ them showgirls.
HACK
Now, that’s what I’m talkin’ about!
Hack breaks out a bag of crystal meth. Waves it at Bear.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Savage examines and admires Reeves’ Desert Eagle. Grinning and fondling.
Reeves, Crafton and Henning check weapons, Henning now wearing two pistols and a belt of magazine pouches.
96
CRAFTON
(to Reeves)
We’re gonna hafta git close for ya’ll to be effective.
SAVAGE
Shee-it. I could hit a man at fifty yards with this baby. Gonna buy me a pair of ‘em when we’re done.
Reeves quickly glances at Henning ... who says nothing.
Savage returns the Eagle to Reeves, then opens an airline carry- on bag and pulls out a fancy pistol. Tooled leather holster. A trio of magazine pouches.
SAVAGE
A pre-World War Two, Colt .38 Super. It was reworked ten years back. Got polished an’ accurized. An’ the serial numbers ain’t in no federal computers.
He hands the weapon to Henning.
SAVAGE
If you have to, wipe it off an’ leave it.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS - NIGHT
Foster relaxes. Lies on his back. Stargazing.
Closer to the river, seventy yards away, Jabber shoots crystal meth into the back of his left hand.
Opposite Jabber, Megan completes their triangle. She sniffs at her Marlboro pack ... clearly wishing she could fire one.
In the riverbed, Nate, Hack and Bear slowly and silently creep along the bank, toward Jabber’s point of the triangle. Nate and Bear now pack shotguns. Hack, an M2 carbine.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/MEXICO - NIGHT
An unarmed TRUCHA (14-15) settles into brush. Leans against a tree. Then pulls a night-vision binocular from a military case. He flicks long hair back from his eyes.
97
EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS - NIGHT
Armed with M-16s and Berettas, cammied and grease-painted, the two U.S. Army Corps of Engineers workers crawl along the
riverbank, work their way into position on Megan’s corner of the robbers’ triangle.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/MEXICO - NIGHT
The Trucha: Watching the Texas side of the river through night glasses.
INSERT - NIGHT-VISION BINOCULAR POV
The eerie green figures of the Corps of Engineers ... WORKERS

The Trucha rises, backs away from the river, then turns and runs.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS - NIGHT
Reeves, Henning, Crafton and Savage cross the asphalt road and, staying low, slowly work their way toward Jabber’s position.
Head barely above the grass, Foster watches the cops.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/MEXICO - NIGHT
Four GUNMEN lounge around a pair of Chevy Suburbans. Quietly shooting the shit, passing joints back and forth.
When the Trucha bursts into view, the JEFE steps from a wagon, wiping on a scoped, chrome-plated AK-74.
TRUCHA              ENGLISH SUPER

EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS - NIGHT
Megan opens her cell phone.
FOSTER (VO)
(whispers)
Company. Behind Jabber, but closer to the river. Cover him once the action begins.
MEGAN
(whispers)
Gotcha. Just don’t let the cop get away in the truck. You think Jabber set us up?
FOSTER (VO)
(whispers) I don’t know.

EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS - WEE HOURS
Jabber sweats. His EYES dart back and forth. He squinches his nose. Rubs at it with one hand, then the other.
BEAR (VO)
(whispers)
We gotta find Jabber.
99
Crickets BUZZ. Frogs CROAK.
HACK (VO)
(whispers)
Bullshit, we need more blow.
NATE (VO)
(whispers)
Keep that shit in yer pocket. You already had plenty.
Careful of noise, Jabber licks a little finger, dips it into a medicine phial. Jams the white-powdered fingertip up a nostril and wiggles it around.
Foster: On his knees in high, dead grass. Still as a statue. Looking back up the road. He yawns.
Megan can see both men’s positions, but Jabber’s holds her attention.
She punches REDIAL on her cell phone.
MEGAN
(whispers)
We forgot night glasses.
Two hundred feet away, something SPLASHES in shallow water.
Megan turns in that direction for a second, then locates Jabber.
FOSTER (OS)
(whispers)
We know where the players are. Relax. Nearly a full moon.
Romantic.
MEGAN
(whispers)
Sounds like a scared man talking.
FOSTER
(whispers)
Sometimes, Megan, you’re too god- damn smart for anybody’s good.
EXT. DIRT TRACK/RIO GRANDE/TEXAS - FIRST LIGHT
Headlights ... the Border Patrol Bronco swings around, then backs down almost to the bank. Dressed and armed as before, the Patrolman now slings a Heckler & Koch MP5 around his neck the second his feet touch sand.
100
He stands still. Hands on the MP5. Scans the area. Listening. Beside the crumbly remnants of an old house foundation, Foster
lies on his side ... against a concrete footing that is also home to the five foot ...
RATTLESNAKE
... Which lies coiled less than three feet from Foster’s nose.
FOSTER
(whispers)
Go away. I don’t want to hurt you
... but you AIN’T bitin’ me.
Foster inches his rifle barrel forward.
The rattler RATTLES. Strikes at the FN-FAL’s front sight. Far enough. Foster sweeps with the barrel. Nudges the snake,
which slithers off into the grass. Foster closes his eyes. Loudly sighs.
Satisfied, the cop steps into the brush. Drags the long fiberglass canoe to the rear of his vehicle.
Next, he opens the cargo door, and ... JABBER
... SNEEZES. Then SNORTS and SNOGGLES.
Foster raises up, rifle to his shoulder, but can’t get a target.
FOSTER
(yells)
Fedderman’s not coming! Give it up! Walk away! Alive!
EXT. RIO GRANDE/MEXICO - CONTINUOUS
The Trucha jumps to his feet, dashes back toward the jefe’s trucks.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS - CONTINUOUS
Out from Jabber’s position, but behind him and closer to the riverbank, Reeves rises. Holds his badge between fingers of the hand encased in plaster.
REEVES
Freeze! Police!
101
From a duelist’s stance, Reeves swivels, alternately aims his Desert Eagle at Foster, then at the Border Patrolman.
On the ground at Reeves’ feet, Henning looks up, then shifts her glassy-eyed gaze to Savage and Crafton. Slowly shakes her head.
She palms a Glock. Struggles to her feet.
HENNING
(disgustedly mumbles)
You blew our edge, dumbass. We didn’t come here to arrest people.
REEVES
(under his breath) I forgot.
Crafton grabs his old Browning BAR. He and Savage rise. Fan out.
HENNING
Yeah. There’s no Department rules for killing and robbing fugitives.
FOSTER (OS)
Damned if I don’t recognize the sunglasses.
REEVES
You want me to shoot him?
CRAFTON
Hell no! Not till we know where that Garza bitch is.
Plainly confused, the BP Agent gawps at the cops. Then he rises to tiptoe. Peers over the roof at Foster.
FOSTER (OS)
And the pissed off female cop.
Face and hair covered and studded with dry stalks and Johnson grass blades, Megan slowly raises her head. Looks around. Catches sight of the Corps of Engineers ...
WORKERS
... As they appear from behind the wellhouse. Then she slowly sinks from sight.
MEGAN (OS)
Shit!
102
The USCE gunmen ignore Foster. Silently look toward the cops. Aim M-16s their direction.
Jabber sneezes again. Groans his way up. Shotgun pointed toward the rear of the Bronco.
Savage aims a Remington 741 at Jabber.
Because the Bronco blocks a view of Jabber, the USCE gunmen aim at the cops, but one occasionally shifts his barrel toward Foster.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/MEXICO - CONTINUOUS
The Trucha practically drags the Jefe onto a dirt road, a move which permits a view of the action four hundred odd yards away.
The Jefe SNAPS fingers. A mustached pistolero, JALISCO, rushes forward. Hands the Jefe his duded-up AK-74.
JEFE               ENGLISH SUPER
Gracias, Jalisco.         Thank you, Jalisco.
JALISCO             ENGLISH SUPER

The Jefe throws the rifle to his shoulder. Through the scope, checks the doings on the far side.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/TEXAS - CONTINUOUS
Nate, Bear and Hack rise and fan out, Hack throwing down on the BP Patrolman, Bear and Nate on Henning and her crew.
Foster blinks, eyes the USCE workers. Shifts his barrel to a point between them and the Bronco. Then shifts back to the cops.
FOSTER (VO)
No fucking doubt about their intentions. Here to dust your favorite parolee’s ass.
Impasse. Seemingly eternal. Silence. Glances flit from one target to another. Fear. No one allows a gaze to linger.
Jabber sneezes again.
EXT. RIO GRANDE/BOTH SIDES - CONTINUOUS
The Jefe dons his western hat. Stuffs an S&W .44 magnum into his belt. Gathers his MEN.

Smiles all around. Nods of agreement.
The Jefe spreads his arms wide, then slowly spear points his fingers and brings the tips together.
JEFE               ENGLISH SUPER

LOUIS and Jalisco nod. The other two gunmen break out AK-47s. Pistols.
Grins. Itchy macho.
The Trucha comes running. Packs an AK. Halts and looks to his boss. The boy’s expression begs permission.
The Jefe nods. Makes a shooing gesture toward the river.
JEFE               ENGLISH SUPER
Ve! Ve! Mata uno por mi!     Go! Go! Kill one for me!
Foster watches the Suburbans circle and park nose to nose on the far bank.
Mexicans scramble from the vehicles. The Jefe heads into waist high rocks. Then, Jalisco and Louis set up a bi-podded M-60 machine gun on a hood.
Foster drops to the grass. Looks around to make sure he hasn’t disturbed the homeowner. His phone faintly beeps.
Megan: On her cell phone.
MEGAN
Is that what I think it is?
FOSTER (OS)
Can’t tell from here. But, probably. Probably what Vietnam vets call a spacegun.
104
MEGAN
We need to get out of here. Should’ve bought another phone. Work down and tell Jabber. I’ll cover you.
Foster raises his head above the grass.
The Jefe raises the Kalashnikov to his shoulder. In the scope, he finds ...
FOSTER
... And hauls back on the trigger. Loses control of the weapon. The barrel rises ... spews lead way too high ... until the magazine empties.
He squints at Foster. Who hasn’t budged. Hasn’t even noticed bullets.
The M-60 opens fire at Nate, Bear and Hack, who drop straight into the grass without firing a shot.
HACK
Damn!
The Trucha blasts away at the COPS.
The pistoleros with AK-47s fire on the wellhouse ... BULLETS
... Pock the gray walls.
The Trucha’s weapon barrel veers upward and off target before jamming. He ducks.
The USCE gunslingers return fire. Hang weapons around the corners to avoid exposing bodies.
Nate and Bear blast several rounds at the cops, then drop to the ground. Hack follows their lead. Empties a 30-round magazine in a few seconds.
Hack and Bear snort meth before they reload.
Of the cops, only Crafton is far enough out to see the wellhouse. The others fire toward Jabber’s crew. Bullets that land out in the riverbed ... reaching toward Jalisco and Louis.
The M-60 dispatches a storm of lead. Raises a din that has everyone hugging ground. The M-60 jams.
Foster rises. Fires at the machine gun crew.
Damnit!
MEGAN (OS)
105
The BP Patrolman pivots around the rear fender. Unloads half a magazine toward Foster.
Jabber fires at the BP Agent. Misses. Demolishes a taillight.
The agent’s bullets miss Foster, who belly crawls along the ground. He rises. Blasts two quick rounds toward the USCE gunmen
... then the THUMP, THUMP, THUMP of Crafton’s BAR sends him diving to the grass.
Holy shit!
FOSTER
Megan rises. Blasts three rounds at targets across the river, where a ...
TIRE
... POPS. Two more bullets pierce the fender.
Megan drops. Instantly crawls to a different position.
The Jefe aims at Megan. Too late. As he turns toward Jabber ... MEGAN
... Pops up again. Looses a pair of three-round bursts ...
... Old NATO rounds chew brush and tree bark around the Jefe. He dives for cover. Loses his hat, then exposes himself to retrieve it.
Megan notices ... SAVAGE
... For the first time. Then drops. She quickly crawls to a new position. Eases up. Eyes barely above the grass.
The Mexicans with AKs concentrate fire on the cops, who drop as the rifles chatter until slides rack open.
Crafton bounces up, thumps off several long bursts ...
... River rocks split. Debris flies.
MEGAN (OS)
Now, I want to believe in justice.
Foster adds a burst to Crafton’s.
106
The M-60 opens up on the well house.
... Rather than pock concrete, the .308 rounds knock great CHUNKS loose. Expose REBAR in places.
Jabber stays low. Searches over the shotgun barrel for Foster. Under the Bronco, the BP Agent seeks a shot at Foster.
Hack, Bear and Nate nod at each other, then rise together, blasting ineffectually at the cops, then Mexicans, who score.
Bear catches a round in the belly. Doubles. Then catches a second AK bullet in the top of his head.
Scared now, Hack and Nate hit the ground before Bear’s body.
Hack scrambles on all-fours. Drags his M2 through dirt and debris. 30 feet before he stops.
Hyperventilating, Hack digs his meth bag from a pocket. Snorts from the bag. Grins to himself. Bullets WHIZZ overhead.
Reeves and Henning rise. Stand side by side. Henning firing at Nate’s direction. Reeves slowly blasting at Foster.
Savage loses four .30 caliber slugs at the ...
... Jefe, who ducks and reloads.
As his partners duck, Crafton rises; chops at the machine gun; then Megan joins in; and Foster ...
... .308 and .30-06 bullets rip through doors. Quarter panels.
The gunmen with AKs flee when .30 caliber rounds sail all the way through the Chevy. They take cover in the rocks with the Trucha.
At the other Suburban, Jalisco and Louis hug the ground. Hands cover heads. The M-60 momentarily forgotten.
Hack reloads. Mumbles to himself:
HACK
Ain’t but one stud on this here farm!
He rises. Spots Megan and swings his M2 around. Blasts one short burst before the weapon jams.
Megan swings her rifle to Hack.
Hack flinches. Ticks his head right as wind from a second round ruffles his hair. And ...
BLOOD
... Drips onto his hand.
HACK
107
Bitch shot me!
He flinches again ... leftward. Drops to all-fours and scuttles a few feet. Checks himself. Both ears bleeding.
HACK
Bitch shot my ears! Bullets tear up the grass overhead. M2 forgotten, Hack scrambles away.
Megan ducks. Resets the selector switch to AUTO.
The Trucha rises. Fires at the wellhouse. Rounds hit the target. Chip concrete in a dozen spots.
When fire subsides, both USCE gunslingers concentrate on the young Mexican Trucha.
High velocity M-16 rounds tear into his upper body. He wilts. Before the body hits the sand, one bullet blows open a fist size hole in the back of the kid’s head. A coaster-size piece of bloody ...
SKULL
... With foot-long hank of hair attached ... swirls through the air. Until gravity brings it down ... wraps it around a pistolero’s ...
FACE.
He panics. Claws loose the hair and bone fragment. Springs up. Runs. Four steps ...
... A bullet plows through his back ...
... Foster ducks. Again looks all around for the snake. Nate runs for the riverbank’s shelter.
Crafton shifts the BAR’s aim. THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. Misses. Patient. The BP Agent waits. Until ...
FOSTER
... Runs a magazine dry.
Bur-r-up! Three rounds.
FOSTER
108
(breath explodes)
Ugh!
Foster sits. Shakes his head. Gasps. Then studies two holes on the far sides of his abdomen.
The Corps of Engineers soldiers cut loose at Crafton. Too late. Shift to a pistolero. Too late. Then blast away at the Mexican kid’s body. Waste of ammunition.
Jabber fires at the BP Cop ...
... Churns a dust cloud that obscures his target. Megan blasts two bursts at the USCE gunmen ...
... Misses ...
... Misses again when she swings to fire at Henning. Two more bursts at Henning. Misses.
Megan flops to the ground. Crawls five yards.
MEGAN (VO)
(stares at Galil)
Soldier’s rifle. But I’m not a damn soldier. Hunt.
Hack claws past a half-full, liter-size Mountain Dew ... BOTTLE
... Five feet before he stops. He blinks. Turns and scrambles back.
Henning empties a Glock at the other pistolero. Uselessly attracts his attention.
While a pistolero aims at Henning, the USCE M-16s open up. RIDDLE the gunman.
Foster gets to his feet. Wobbly. The BP Cop fires again. Misses because ...
JABBER
... Finds his target ...
... Buckshot tears into the MP5. SHREDS the agent’s left hand. The next shower of buckshot separates the lower jaw from his face.
The Jefe fires single shots now. At ... FOSTER.
109
Uff!
FOSTER
He sits again. A third hole right above the left hip bone. Far to the outside.
Megan locates Jalisco and Louis. Relocates herself, then rises to knees and slowly clocks two rounds. . .
... Both plow through fender—into the engine compartment ...
... She re-aims: Fires higher ...
A .308 bullet smashes into the M-60's bipod. Swings the barrel to the windshield.
Louis steps back toward the door. Ducks ...
... THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. Bullets from the BAR rip through the river-side ...
DOOR
... Cross over the seat. Through the driver’s ... DOOR
... Deformed lead slices through metal. The first catches Louis in the eye. A second gouges through his back and the third shreds his shoulder ...
... Then, .30-06 rounds from the BAR chew up the rear end. Down low. The rear tire gushes air. And ...
GASOLINE
... Squirts into the sand.
Megan checks on the cops again. Ducks down. Moves.
Savage jumps up. Aims his Remington across the river and empties the magazine. A little tick of the head.
His body drops across Henning’s legs, his blood soaking her knees.
HENNING
Get it off! Get it off!
110
Megan waits for Crafton to rise. Fat chance. Then she drops to the grass. Grins to herself.
Crafton shoves the body aside.
Shaky hands. Hack opens the Mountain Dew bottle. Guzzles, then
checks to see if he left a little in the bottom. Sets the bottle upright in one spot, the bottle cap in another.
Meth bag: Hack tries to dump the remainder into the cap. Misses. He pinches meth, debris, and dirt from the ground. Dumps everything into the cap.
Pours in some Mountain Dew.
Henning pops a bottle lid. Eats two.
Nate bails over the bank into the riverbed. Raises his head, looks back just as Jabber blasts a round at him.
NATE
It’s me, Nate! You fuckin’ jughead!
Jabber aims again. Fires as Nate ducks.
NATE
Godd—
The AK-74 bur-r-ups. Rounds pin Nate against the bank ...
... The Jefe fires till he runs empty.
Crafton rises. Three round bursts. At the Jefe’s position. But the Mexican stays out of sight. Crafton swings to the wellhouse. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.
... Megan: Back to full-auto. Three-round bursts at the wellhouse
...
... The USCE gunmen stagger into the grass ... riddled, and ...
... Unison: Galil and BAR. The wellhouse weakens in the middle as rounds completely free rebar from concrete; it sags, then collapses.
Megan ducks.
Then Crafton.
Hack pulls a 60cc veterinary syringe from his hip pocket and fits the needle to its end. He removes the huge plunger. Lays it on the ground.
Hack ties off his left arm.
111
Hack dumps green liquid from the bottle cap into the syringe. Bits of ...
GRASS
... Float on top.
Shaky hands ... again. He eyes the concoction.
HACK
Looks a little thick.
He adds more Mountain Dew.
Hack jabs the needle at a vein. Misses.
HACK
Shit!
He looks around, searching the ground.
Megan rises. Twenty yards from her last position. She aims toward the cops. No targets.
Wheels toward Foster’s position. Nothing. Jabber and the Jefe exchange fire.
Megan tries, but can’t get a clear shot at the Mexican.
Foster. On his feet. Rifle to his shoulder. Clearly out of it.
Jabber pivots. Blasts one round at Foster. A miss. Pumps his slide and shoulders his weapon. And catches a ...
ROUND
... Through his ear. His ... EYES
... Erupt from their sockets. Blood blasts out the opposite side of his head.
Megan and Foster. Stare at each other. Until she motions him to get down.
The volume of GUNFIRE diminishes. Frantic, Hack finally finds a reasonably flat rock ... on which he sharpens his spike.
Henning holds the Colt .38 Super. Watches ... CRAFTON
112
... Change magazines on the BAR. Slow and methodical. The bullets in the clip have red ...
TIPS.
Crafton rises. In rhythm now. Fires a burst at the Jefe. Then shifts fire to the wounded Suburban ...
... On the ground, a tracer ... ROUND
... Ignites gasoline. The near-empty tank explodes. Tosses a torched ...
JALISCO
... Back onto the sand. Henning shoots ...
CRAFTON
... In the back of his head. Looks to Reeves:
He grins. Gives her a thumbs up. Slams a full magazine into his Desert Eagle. He rises. Two steps. Trying for a shot at Megan.
Henning fires. Sends a round through the upper end of Reeves’ spine. The body twitches after falling. She pumps four bullets into it.
Hack fumbles to get the needle into his vein.
Megan: Hidden in bushes near the USCE gunmen’s bodies. Practically unseeable. She scans:
Across the river. A flash. Sun off metal.
Megan flicks the selector lever to full auto. Aims carefully. Unleashes and barrage ...
... Half a dozen bullets find the Jefe.
Henning sits, holds the Colt between her knees. Slaps in a full magazine. Then calmly reloads the Glock. Finished, she places the Colt in her right hand. Hefts the Glock with her left. Grins.
Hack: Blood dribbling down his arm. Finally finds his vein. Depresses the plunger.
His eyelids spring wide open.
113
Megan drops. Checks for loaded magazines. None. She plucks yellow hearing protectors from her ears.
Then, she listens. Nothing. Then ...
HACK (OS)
Ye-ah! Flag’s up now, Bi-itch!
Hack rises from the grass. Python hanging down from his right hand. Looks around for Megan.
She rises. Throws the rifle to her shoulder and hastily triggers a round.
Beside Hack’s belly button, DUST puffs from his shirt. Megan’s slide racks open.
Hack grabs his crotch. Shakes at her.
HACK
Dum’ bitch. I got whut chew need.
He starts walking toward her.
Megan drops the rifle, palms her .45. Fires two rounds. A third, but distance makes her miss.
Hack keeps coming.
HACK
Got whut all yew ‘ho’s want. Teach yo bitch ass ta shoot at me.
Megan fires again.
The ROUND knocks meat from Hack’s right shoulder, but he hangs on to the revolver. Walking. Not even trying to shoot.
HACK
Ah’m the only stud aroun’ heah!
Two rounds punch into his left chest, but Hack doesn’t stagger. Focused.
Megan fires twice more. Misses. Fires again. Her slide racks open.
The bullet lifts DUST on Hack’s lower right chest.
Ten feet between them. Hack lumbering forward. Grinning.
HACK
Ah’m the man o’ yo dreams!
114
Megan slams another magazine into the butt. Drops the safety lever.
Hack closes.
Megan raises the barrel right to the end of Hack’s nose. Pops the round.
Hack wilts. Drops. BLOOD sprays high into the air.
Megan drops. Scrambles away. Then raises her head. Looks around. Silence.
Megan rises. Sprints. Headlong toward Foster.
Beyond pistol range, Henning rises. An apparition: Colt hung sideways in the injured-side hand. Glock in the other hand. Blasts away with the Colt. Empties the weapon. Empties the Glock.
A rifle BOOMS: The round knocks plaster from the cast ... causing Henning to drop the Colt.
Megan takes careful aim. Fires. Misses. Fires again. Misses.
Henning drops the Glock, grabs the other one from her waist holster. Fires one round after another. One slug ...
... Knicks Megan’s forearm. Megan nonetheless takes deliberate aim.
A NATO round BOOMS.
The round knocks away a fist-size chunk of plaster cast. Henning drops her pistol as she falls. Eyes the Glock. Grabs it. Gets to her feet. Glares at Megan.
HENNING
(slurry mumble) Bitch!
Foster: Drops the FN. Draws and empties the .45 at Henning. Misses. Thumbs the slide closed. Pulls the trigger. CLICK.
Henning aims.
Megan fires ...
... The round catches Henning high in the hip bone. Takes her down.
Megan wheels, starts toward Foster, who raises his ... RIFLE.
115
Megan raises the .45. Foster fires.
Behind and thirty yards to the side of Megan, Henning’s ... HEAD
... Sprays red across ten feet of grass. Foster eases himself down into the grass. Megan. Runs.
Legs stretched out in front, Foster sits, the .45 in his right hand. On his lap. Not threatening. But ready. He stares up at Megan.
She stands over him. Pistol in hand. Hanging alongside her leg. Stares. Then ... slowly ... she raises the weapon. Shoves it into her holster. Stares.
Foster levers up his safety. Holsters the piece. Leans back. Lies on the grass.
MEGAN
No! You can’t quit. We have to move.
Megan helps him sit upright. Pulls yellow plugs from his ears.
FOSTER
Drive! Bring the Bronco.
She fires a pair of cigarettes. Sticks one between his lips, then races away.
To Henning’s body: Cigarette clamped between teeth, she searches the dead cop’s pockets. Then to Jabber. Again searches pockets. Last to Reeves.
As Megan snatches painkillers from Reeves’ pocket, a bloody ... FOREARM
... Circles under her chin ... squeezes.
She reaches for her pistol, but another hand grabs it first, tosses the weapon away. She grabs the hand ... snaps the little
...
FINGER
116
... and Savage howls. Yells again when her teeth sink into his
forearm. She spins away, but quickly recloses, digs a thumb into one of his eyes, then backs off. She spots his rifle.
Savage charges, only to catch the butt of his Remington in the teeth.
Megan knocks him down, delivers blow after blow with the paddled butt. Useless. She throws the weapon at him. Retreats to snatch her .45 from the ground.
Savage throws up his hands.
SAVAGE
No! No! I gotta wife an’—
Megan triggers four rounds, spins before the deputy’s body hits dirt. She grabs Reeves’ painkillers, then sprints to the Bronco.
INT. BRONCO - MORNING
Megan. Driving. Silent tears. Listening to Foster.
FOSTER
Easier out here on the highway. Doesn’t hurt nearly as much.
MEGAN
Stop prattling! Tell me what the hell we have to do!
FOSTER
Grab the Buick. Ditch this. Mexico. We store the money. Try Matamoros. Doctors there who only care about dollars.
She hands him Reeves’ pill bottle.
MEGAN
Take two. Smoke. Ease the pain.
EXT. QUICKSAND PIT - DAY
Megan parks. Bails out. Sprints to the Bronco. Grabs the driver’s door handle.
Foster holds up a bloody hand to halt her.
117
FOSTER
Unload. Fill the trunk first. Then put duffels on the rear floor and seat ... but keep them below window level.
Megan sets ice chest and rope on the ground.
Races back and forth. Struggles with the weight of the bags.
FOSTER
Unzip one. Look inside.
She unzips. Hold the bags so Foster can see. Hundred dollar bills.
MEGAN
Too many. I have two left.
FOSTER
Put them on the passenger-side floor.
She turns away to follow instructions, then wheels back. Dashes forward. Jerks open the door.
Foster: Holding both bloody hands across his abdomen.
MEGAN
You lied. God, Foster. Bright red. That’s arterial blood.
FOSTER
Small artery ... or I’d be dead. Long ago.
(grits & sucks air)
Put the goddamn duffel bags in the car, Megan! Now!
I ... I—
MEGAN
FOSTER
Damn you! Don’t waste this!
She unloads the bags. Two trips to the Buick. Foster starts the engine.
Megan dashes back. Stands by the door. Staring at him.
FOSTER
Do you understand now?
She nods. Unable to speak.
FOSTER
Small-time. Big-time. Only thing that matters is how you exit.
118
Foster—
MEGAN
FOSTER
Sh-h. We’ve said everything that’s important. Didn’t we? Didn’t even need words.
Megan again nods.
FOSTER
One thing more to tell you. These days with you ... that score ... nothing’s worth more. I wouldn’t trade a long life for them.
He slams the shifter into Reverse. Floors the gas.
Megan runs alongside. Then races back when he shifts gears. The Bronco dives into the sand. Bobs. Begins to settle.
Foster grimaces, looks to Megan. Then, he spots the rope. Pleasure alters his expression.
FOSTER
I’ll be damned. That new rope.
He shakes his head. Awe. Then he smiles.
FOSTER
Doesn’t matter now. Enjoy yourself, Megan. Enjoy yourself. Enjoy life.
(grimaces)
Can’t do this ... the drownin’ shit. Turn your head.
He brings up the .45 barrel. Drops the safety. CLICK. Tries again. CLICK. Slowly blinks. Eyes Megan.
FOSTER
Forgot to reload. Got another clip somewhere.
He looks down toward his waist.
119
MEGAN
(growls)
No. Goddamn you! You talk about goin’ hard! Well, suck it the hell up!
Megan wheels. Sprints to the rear of the Buick. Grabs the rope. Stares at the ice chest.
MEGAN
Ice! We can slow the bleeding!
She ties rope to the car’s trailer hitch. Other end to her waist.
MEGAN
You’re not gonna die! I won’t stand for it!
Megan sprints toward the pit. Leaps ...
FREEZE FRAME
MEGAN
(screams)
Do you fuckin’ hear me?
FADE OUT
