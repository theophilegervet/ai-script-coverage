Later in the first act, a catalyst occurs, that confronts the main character (the Protagonist) with a call to action (desire, problem, goal, mission). The second act usually depicts the Protagonist's attempt to resolve the problem, only to find themselves in ever worsening situations. They are not yet able to deal with the problem and must learn something. This is referred to as a character arc. The third act features the resolution of the story and its subplots. The climax is the scene or sequence in which the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question answered, making the Protagonist and other characters grow.
