In the bustling streets of New York, KATHLEEN KELLY (35), a charming and resilient bookstore owner, begins her day with an anticipation that extends beyond the daily routine of managing her quaint children's bookstore, "The Shop Around the Corner." Amidst the regular chores and occasional confrontations with garbagemen, Kathleen finds solace in her secret online correspondence with NY 152, unaware that her advisor and confidant is none other than her business rival, JOE FOX (35), the heir to the Foxbooks Superstore chain. Their worlds collide as Foxbooks prepares to open a new outlet on Columbus Avenue, threatening the very existence of Kathleen's store. Meanwhile, personal lives intertwine when Frank Navasky, Kathleen's boyfriend, encounters reclusive author William Spungeon, and Joe forges connections with his family and Kathleen through unexpected encounters involving his niece, Annabel, and nephew, Matt.

As the Foxbooks Superstore opens its doors, the professional rivalry between Kathleen and Joe escalates, culminating in a very public confrontation. Despite their shared antagonism, the emails between NY 152 and Kathleen grow more intimate, revealing vulnerabilities and innermost thoughts. Kathleen's store, however, struggles under the shadow of the Foxbooks' success, leading to an emotional rally and media showdown that further distress the bookstore owner. Simultaneously, Joe contemplates his life choices, questioning the person he has become arising from his corporate obligations. In parallel, the lives of their acquaintances unfold, with Frank pursuing journalistic dreams, and members of the bookstore's staff, like George, readjusting to new realities. As Kathleen faces the painful decision to close her mother's store, both her and Joe must confront the inevitable transformations in their lives.

The eventual closure of "The Shop Around the Corner" marks a period of reflection and re-evaluation for Kathleen. She finds support in her friends and takes comfort in the rearrangement of her personal space, where her computer continues to be a portal to her anonymous friend, Joe. A series of misunderstandings about each other's personal lives complicates their relationship even further, with Joe mistaken about his marital status and Kathleen uncertain about Joe's intentions. As the first day of spring brings new beginnings, the two agree to finally meet face-to-face. The moment of truth arrives at Riverside Park, where Kathleen's realization that her confidant is, in fact, Joe—her business adversary—transforms into a climactic embrace and kiss, symbolizing the resolution of their conflicts and the blossoming possibility of love that transcends their initial adversarial roles.
